This company no longer exists. You can verify by googling ""Addstones"" and see that it says ""permanently closed"" on google maps. Also navigating to www.addstones.com leads ""site can't be reached.""

I share my first-hand experience since I recently joined the Cortlex team. Also, I logged in to a company's GitHub account with the permission of the HR department, which has account ownership.

So, the interview process for Cortlex was spot-on and hassle-free. First, I told a recruiter about myself and described my work experience. After that, we had a call with a technical specialist (who is also my mentor currently; he explains the company's processes and answers my questions). He asked me more about my technical expertise, language, libraries, and databases. There were no riddles and HackerRank problems to solve. Instead, we had a friendly, respectful conversation, and they checked my knowledge of things they use in their projects.

After that - it was all good, and we continued with an offer!

1. Phone screen with recruiter
2. Technical screen in the form of a pair-programming session to debug and test existing code

There is also a cultural/behavioral fit round, but that does not involve coding/design demonstrations.

1240: Add Poll Everywhere r=poteto a=mdiebolt

Our technical assessment tries to mirror day-to-day contributions as much as we can. It asks the candidate to build a _very_ stripped down version of our core product experience. The follow-up interview is to assess team collaboration and pairs the candidate with a Designer and Engineer to enhance what they built in the challenge round.

1217: Remove Instacart r=poteto a=samanthawritescode

I applied to Instacart through this list, but won't be going forward with their process. The recruiter, documents that recruiter sent, and further research on Blind, Glassdoor, etc. indicate that they do tech screens through a 3rd party (karat), so you don't even talk to an engineer at the company. Apparently in that screen CS knowledge/topic questions are asked and you're expected to get through 2 leetcode-esque questions in 30 or so minutes. None of this ""resembles day-to-day work"" to me. 

I don't think that this process fits the spirit of this list at all, but at the very least there's a mismatch in the real process and what's describes here.

## Interview Process:
I recently met with a senior engineer and did a half behavioral / half coding exercise interview.  The coding exercise was a CS trivia/brainteaser/riddle/puzzle/etc on HackerRank and had nothing to do with the day-to-day tasks of the job.  Since this fails to meet the criteria for this list, I am requesting that GoDaddy be removed.

I applied to Instacart through this list, but won't be going forward with their process. The recruiter, documents that recruiter sent, and further research on Blind, Glassdoor, etc. indicate that they do tech screens through a 3rd party (karat), so you don't even talk to an engineer at the company. Apparently in that screen CS knowledge/topic questions are asked and you're expected to get through 2 leetcode-esque questions in 30 or so minutes. None of this ""resembles day-to-day work"" to me.

1182: Move ""pay the candidate for their time"" to the top in RECOMMENDATIONS.md r=poteto a=LrWm3

I think paying candidates for the time required to complete take home interviews up to 4 hours in length is a requirement for assigning take home interviews in an ethical manner. Not everyone can afford to work for free for X hours per interview. Given the imbalance of power in an interview setting, asking people to work for 2 to 4 hours for free just does not seem fair.

Additionally, many of the take home interview recommendations are ""soft"" and somewhat ambiguous. Is a take-home interview 4 hours? are the questions related to the job itself? the interviewer and interviewee may disagree on these points.

however, it is completely umbiguous whether or not candidates are being paid for the time they spend on take-home interviews. companies are either doing it or not. it's harder to handwave away.

This PR moves ""pay the candidate for their time"" to the top of the take-home interview suggestions list in recommendations.md

1184: Remove DHH tweet from README. r=poteto a=adunkman


DHH has become [a controversial figure in recent years over management decisions](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy), and as such may turn people off to the work being done in this repo (it does for me, at least!). 

I think the project would be just as, or more, effective without the reference tweet!

For my interview I initially had a conversation with my future manager about who the company is and what they do (which is define and provide materials for primary education curricula) as well as a discussion about the topology of the team in order to get some idea about how the team operates as well as what I could expect systems to look like given that Conway's Law has some merit. The next step was to have a call with a pair of existing team members to discuss my experiences with the tools we'd be using as well as discussing how I have handled pressure in the past, as well as to discuss a hypothetical architecture concept because I would be creating a lot of cloud infrastructure in my role and they wanted to get an idea of how I would approach the sort of problem solving that I would be doing day to day. The architecture concept was realistic, and not esoteric at all.

For our virtual on-site, we provide candidates the option of breaking them into two separate sessions. We understand how exhausting 4-5 hours of talking/interviewing could be, and we value our candidates experience. We also appreciate candidates' feedback and continuously iterate on our hiring process with this in mind.

## Additional context

We have 3 rounds of interviews.
1. First round is the introduction round where get to know the person and their experience. This is done on a video call via google meet. This session lasts for around 30 min.  
If suits fit, we send the take-home task via email which contains a real-world coding exercise very close to what we do on daily basis at work.
2. Once the candidate submits an assignment, we get on a call for a code walkthrough and a further discussion. This is also done via google meet call and lasts for about 1 to 1.5 hours. We focus on fundamentals and **do not ask DS Algo questions.**
3. Last round is culture fit found.

There's a Live Coding test where candidates are asked to code a feature equivalent to tasks they'd be performing everyday (ex: calling an API, parsing data and showing the result on the screen)

Given that we are a globally distributed team and much of our communication is asynchronous, we like the hiring process to resemble the ways that we work each day.

In the spirit of [Automattic's process](automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers), we add you to our recruitment Slack, and we take it from there. Essentially it'll be some general discussion that we'll do asynchronously, and then we schedule a 60 min block of time where you and he will have a more technical Slack conversation.

From there we give you a short take-home coding challenge, and if that goes well a short pairing session to go over your solution.

## Notes
- After the initial 1 hour tech screen, a decision will be made to stop or continue on to the longer set of interviews.
- The process can vary by team. For example, more front-end focused teams will employ a React refactoring problem and a JavaScript/React focused build.
- The sequence of the four interviews is not important. They do not cover the same topic and can be done in any order.
- The manager chat can happen before or after the four interviews and is sometimes used as a decision point.
- The level of the position can alter the amount and type of interviews. The example shown is for a mid-level or senior role. Internships will have less interviews and be simpler. Staff level will have a larger system focus, longer (some are 1.5 hours), and perhaps more (6) interviews.

Interviewed with them in August 2021. Was asked to solve a question straight from Leetcode Premium during a virtual interview with interviewer watching. Interviewer even mentioned that it's from Leetcode and to let them know if I've seen it already.

1135: Add EatSleepRIDE r=poteto a=BrentMifsud

Toronto based startup. They have a pretty fair interview process.

First interview is an interview with the CTO. Talks about candidates experience, sometimes will ask to do a code walkthrough or see some of the candidates existing work or projects.

Following this interview there is a take-home assignment that is relevant to the job the candidate will be doing. For example, mobile take home I had to hit their api, and plot some of the locations on the map.

Finally there is a behavioural interview with the remaining engineers and the CEO.

There was a follow call after this to discuss salary.

- We use a live-coding site (Coderpad) but only as a shared IDE as we are a remote company. All of the questions are developed internally and are adapted from problems we have solved. We pair with the candidate on solving the coding questions.
- The pre-interview prep allows candidates to process the question and come up with a solution without the pressure of the interview. In the final interview, the candidate walks us through their solution, and after some discussion, we pair with them to implement a feature change on top of their solution.

## Additional context

This is primarily geared towards the iOS interviews (though Android is probably similar). 

The take-home exercise (they refer to it as the ""coding assessment"") asks you to build out a small app along with a design sheet/spec and to submit the exercise with an estimate of the amount of hours you took to build it (I am a more junior developer and it took me roughly 15 hours, though the UI portion took me much less time). After submission, if your take-home exercise was satisfactory, you are then asked to take part in a video call interview with a few (2-3) engineers - roughly 1 hour long. This video interview involves domain specific knowledge - in my case, it was Swift language fundamentals like optionals, table/collection views, structs vs classes, memory leaks, etc. They also ask some open-ended questions regarding ""bigger picture"" ideas though this isn't really system design.

Varies depending on the team you interview but I did get a leetcode exercise when interviewing with them, there was no option of a take home test or anything like that. There was a ""debugging interview"" where i was presented with a problem and had to go about trying to fix it and there was a distributed systems interview where I spoke about my experience building distributed systems.

Our interview process consists of 3-4 stages, depending on the candidate (and a bit of randomness as to which of the teams they end up being suitable for).

1st step: Interview with HR and one engineering lead, where we give an overview of what we do, and get to know each other a bit better
2nd step: A do-at-home test task, which we don't set a deadline for (but hope you can give an estimate so we won't bother you, if you happen to be busy with something else)
3rd step: A more thorough technical interview, where we discuss your test task, give you feedback and give you an opportunity to meet a few more people from our technical team
4rd step: Depending on the team the candidate finds most appealing, an optional meeting with said team's engineering lead, in most cases acting as a means to just get to know the team a bit better

987: Removes Ableton r=poteto a=brahyam

Removing ableton from the list as a close friend of mine recently had an interview for an iOS position and during the call it was required for him to perform some classic whiteboard challenges trying to produce ascii art. They call it a pair programming session. There was no take home challenge and the discussion was not about some real life problem that their facing in Ableton (unless they are generating ascii art on iOS all day long for their products?????). 

If there is any doubt I can provide the whiteboard challenge files that they send during the interview on request.

Thanks

PS. My friend would like to remain anonymous

Interview stages use a standard rubric across applicants to combat bias in hiring practices. All steps can be completed remotely. Some surface-level trivia for technology-specific senior roles to gauge experience when appropriate (never more than 10% of total points on rubric and not a puzzle or white-boarding session).

The Heroku interview process is very straightforward; it consists of a manager meet and greet followed by a timeboxed independent project, with debrief discussions about various topics relating to running the project you wrote at scale. All languages/frameworks were acceptable and emphasis was placed on operational knowledge rather than ""CS trivia"".

941: adds Ghost Inspector to list r=poteto a=simpixelated

Our internal hiring guide explicitly asks interviewers not to quiz candidates on trivial knowledge. We lean on discussing their experience, specific projects, and reviewing their short take-home test (under 2 hours). This was true when I was hired a year and a half ago and remains true today.

When interviewing with Facebook for a Front End Engineering position all questions are practical ones that people in this role had to solve in the past. For this reason I believe it  passes the criteria defined.

The process is very straightforward and the company tries to make it smooth and fast. The first interview is cultural with a recruiter. If there is a match, the next step is a technical test on the context of the job. When the candidate submits the test, there is a technical interview based on the test and to understand if the expectations technically are aligned with what the company offers. Then, if both agree to continue, there is conversation with the CTO to know the person.

The interview process involves a behavioural phone screen, a on-site technical pair programming exercise and a code review. Both involve adding a feature to a real-world app. There is no whiteboarding involved or algorithmic/academic-centered questions.

LateRooms.com went into administration in August 2019 (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49200999). The brand has been bought by another business, but are no longer the same company. As such I (former Head of Software Engineering at LateRooms.com) cannot vouch for their hiring practises.

Telus does not belong here at all. They always send 90 minute Hackerank/Leetcode style challenge to applicant to ""assess technical skills"". This list is a set of companies who are taking the extra effort to give engineers a dignified application experience and this disqualifies them from being apart of this set.

The process for DevOps candidates has consistently been:

1. A Phone Screen - High Level Discussion with Hiring Manager
2. A Take Home - Under 4 hours is desired for time to put together a project to demonstrate CI/CD workflow of a simple application, and knowledge of relevant technologies such as AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.
3. On-site includes a take-home review, which may also consistent of a short (30 minute) live group/team coding exercise to resolve issues the candidate encountered before and/or to complete/improve on current state of the presentation.

Our current process is basically:

1. Interview with HR
2. Interview with Engineering
3. Project to do at home very related to what we do
4. Debrief interview to talk about the project
5. Final interview with CTO / Director of Engineering

This process may change depending on candidate/position/etc, but it's mostly like that.

I built [No Whiteboards](https://nowhiteboards.io/) which pulls the companies from this repo, crawls their job boards, and indexes their jobs to be easily searchable.

I imagine many of the people who come to this repo are looking for a job. This website provides a more streamlined interface for finding these jobs, which they may find useful. So I believe that adding a link to it will provide value to the community.

Here is an image of the homepage:

<img width=""825"" alt=""No Whiteboards Homepage"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7234013/66888364-0551f900-ef93-11e9-9ea3-ce37e50be5a3.png"">

And here is an image of the company page which contains the interview description:

<img width=""873"" alt=""No Whiteboards Company Page"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7234013/66888463-75f91580-ef93-11e9-80e8-dccc8e3c1882.png"">



It is automatically synced to this repo, so it gets updated when people add their company here. It's not perfect, and doesn't get every company's jobs properly yet, but it is being actively worked on.

We believe in discussions instead of tests. We actually don't have any coding test. Instead we talk about their experience and let them understand our expectations. Works great. We then have an onboarding plan that helps them get started with an experienced mentor.

Tara AI started at Gradberry, who was using AI to scrape GitHub and other open source repositories, link them to LinkedIn and thus identify quality CS schools. We proved that there is no correlation between education and the top contributors to open source. We apply this knowledge, and many other insightful learnings about what was previously best practice to every interview we perform.

Some advice about landing a software engineering job with Canonical:

- Canonical believes very strongly in a fair interview process. Each interviewer is ""blind"" and hasn't seen notes from anyone else that you interview with.
- At least one interview will be from someone outside of your team.
- The company is worldwide-remote and maintains 24/7 operations. It's possible that an interview may occur late in the evening.
- Almost all of the code that you'll be writing is open source. You should feel comfortable operating in that environment.

We have a pretty short hiring process. The first phone screening is done by the Head of Engineering and usually takes 30 minutes. If the candidate seems to fit well, he is invited for a personal interview. In this interview, the candidate is asked to present one of his previous works. If the candidate does not have a project that he can or would like to present, we ask him to complete a take-home task. For junior developers, this consists of the implementation of a small project. For senior developers the task consists of the analysis of a small project with various problems. If everything works out the candidate get's an offer right after this interview.

TransferWise are now ""experimenting"" with a whiteboard interview. The actual (timed) exercise requires use of the awful HackerRank interface, and includes several trivia questions where no Google/StackOverflow is allowed. So much *nope*.

As per TransferWise recruiter email:

> **Tech test** - a bit unusual to start with this but we are currently experimenting this scheme and we thank you in advance for your support with this :) This will be a HackerRank online test which I will send to you after this e-mail (pls check your spam section also to make sure it does not land there). This should take you max. 90 min. and if results are good we'll move ahead. Normally we don't have a fix deadline for completing it but will be great if you can do within 3 days or latest within 1 week which should give you enough time I think. Also, pls focus on the coding questions (which will normally come at the end), as those are weighting the most in the final score :) Please also avoid using Google/finding a solution on Stack Overflow

We keep it fairly straightforward. You'll have a phone screen with us, then a pairing session to work on a small sample problem (no CS stuff, just a little toy problem). After that we have a ""discussion"" style technical interview and a final culture fit interview.

Interview strictly avoids CS trivia, or live coding on a board.
In rare cases where the candidate does not fit the requirements but pulls the ""I learn fast"" card we may consider a take-home task (short and easy one) in one of our frameworks, to prove learning abilities, only if the candidate agrees. But this is rare procedure.

The interview is 100% discussion of real-life issues, in system design, scaling, security, and general knowledge.

767: Added Falcon.io r=poteto a=zainab-shaheen54

Falcon.io's interview process is more focused on personality and motivation rather than rigid whiteboards. Usually, the process starts with a Skype/Phone interview in which you get to know Falcon and they get to know you for the first time. After that a small project boilerplate, in my case a game, is given with certain completion requirements. After the submission there is a discussion about thought processes and certain choices, and then you will the to meet the team.

765: Added SurveySparrow r=poteto a=o-my-code

SurveySparrow follows an interview process which strictly adheres to the no-whiteboard policy. Usually, the process starts with a Skype/Phone interview during which the first level of assessment is done. After that a small project, highly relevant to the job applied for, will be given with a timeframe to complete. Upon the submission of project, if found appropriate, the candidate will be called for a face-to-face interview. The submitted code will be reviewed followed by interviews with a senior developer, HR Manager, CTO and CEO.

CJ is language-agnostic in hiring.  The interview process is designed to test for an understanding of abstraction and software design, and not knowledge of any algorithmic or syntax details.  The phone screen is about 90 minutes long, and the final interview includes some discussion, one design question, and a pair programming exercise.

At Elvie, we highly value our culture and it’s as important to us that you are a good fit in the wider team as well as being a top candidate for the relevant role. That’s why our developer hiring process is more about finding out how you think about solving problems than seeing how you go about solving specific challenges.

We’re pragmatic programmers who have a job to do. We don’t expect you to be able to write a binary parsing algorithm from scratch, but rather to understand that you have the right attitude towards that level of problem solving. We’ll then give the space and support you need to do your best work and learn as you go.
