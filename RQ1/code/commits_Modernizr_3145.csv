b1609a6907950017d9450b2a08c93dd19a66fcfa,2024-10-27 19:59:26,Tushar Kumar,"Update flexgap.js (#2749)

* Update flexgap.js

Added a check for the type of result: In the previous code, there was no check for the type of result. In the updated code, I added a check to ensure that result is a string, and if not, an error message is logged. 4

* Update flexgap.js

Added a check for Safari bug:

var isSupported = flexHeight === 1 || flexHeight === 2;
Reason: Safari, at zoom levels of 50% and 150%, returns scrollHeight as 2 instead of 1 for flex containers. This line ensures the test works across different browsers, including buggy Safari versions.

Positioned the created elements fixed to the top, to prevent any
jumping when (re-)loading the page.
When those elements weren't positioned fixed, they will be rendered at
the top of the document. In the test it's required to reset the
selection by focusing to a dummy input element thus triggering the
jump of the browser's viewport.

This code was added in 2009 via [1] to work around a false-positive in WebKit.
Per [2] both Safari and Chrome have supported transforms since 2009 and 2011
respectively, and current global usage of earlier versions of those products
is negligible. Also note that this code originally attempted to limit itself
to WebKit, but the prefixed properties it detects have since been standardized
and implemented in all browsers.

This code is responsible for significant slowdowns (in the tens of tens of
milliseconds) when loading CNN.
