* ci(circleci): prevent timeout on circle-ci macos node10 build

The circle ci job for macOS on node 10 currently fails because it takes too long
(both PR's #7649 and #7650 don't green because of that). A big chunk of the time
is taken by updating homebrew - which in this macOS (the one connected to xcode 9
=> macOS 10.12) does not contain node 10 by default.

This change:
- sets the required xcode version to 11.0 -> this gets us a more up to date macOS
  version (except for node 6, which isn't available in the homebrew associated
  with xcode 11)
- removes the brew update from the macOS node 10 job

This fixes a bug that was introduced in #6850 where the bin path was being built only from
`config.lockfileFolder`. However in workspaces, bins may not be hoisted to the workspace root,
causing bins to not be found. This change adds `config.cwd` to the bin search path, so the `yarn
run` command will look in a workspace package's node_modules, as well as the workspace root.

* Run the prepare script of git dependencies even if NODE_ENV=production

When installing a git dependency with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to `production`, yarn did not run the `prepare` lifecycle script, because `config.production` would default to true, and then `wrapLifecycle` would skip `prepare`:

This is contrary to npm's behavior and the intent of `GitFetcher#fetchFromInstallAndPack`, which is to install the dependency with its devDependencies and run all the relevant lifecycle scripts (excluding `prepublish`), regardless of the configuration or environment settings of the parent install command.

Closes #7013

**Summary**

A more elaborate description is available in #7013. In short, ensuring scripts are ran in the expected environment can deter hard to diagnose bugs.

**Test plan**

Given a `node` engine requirement that doesn’t match the current environment:

```
$ cat package.json | grep -i1 '""node""'
  ""engines"": {
    ""node"": ""^10.13.0""
  },

$ nvm use 8
Now using node v8.12.0 (npm v6.4.1)
```

A script invocation will fail as follows:

```
$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
error @artsy/reaction@12.1.10: The engine ""node"" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ""^10.13.0"". Got ""8.12.0""
error Commands cannot run with an incompatible environment.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

If need be, this can be overridden with the `--ignore-engines` flag:

```
$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run --ignore-engines relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
$ relay-compiler --src ./src --schema data/schema.graphql --language typescript --artifactDirectory ./src/__generated__ --exclude '**/node_modules/**,**/__mocks__/**,**/__generated__/**'
✨  Done in 2.22s.
```

Or, of course, making the environment match the requirements:

```
$ nvm use 10.13
Now using node v10.13.0 (npm v6.4.1)

$ node ~/Code/JavaScript/yarn/lib/cli/index.js run relay
yarn run v1.15.0-0
$ relay-compiler --src ./src --schema data/schema.graphql --language typescript --artifactDirectory ./src/__generated__ --exclude '**/node_modules/**,**/__mocks__/**,**/__generated__/**'

Fix bug #7079 of `basicSemverOperatorRegex`. It doesn't match the range operator correctly if the dependency range is specified with `>=`. For example, when running `yarn upgrade --latest`, if a dependency is specified with `>=`, the matched result will be `>`, which is not correct.

also clean files from `node_modules`. This no longer happens, only the `--modules-folder` location

The `yarn check` command used to always only check `node_modules`. Now it will check the

When running a command or executing a lifecycle script, yarn
would build a `PATH` that included `node_modules/.bin` first, then add the `--modules-folder`'s

* fix(pnp): make sure that the package locator is...

... fetched with a trailing slash

I could not get P'n'P working on a project using `critical`[1] and
traced it down to a lookup of a package locator without a trailing
slash.

A `require('resolve').sync('fg-loadcss')` from `inline-critical`[2]
would fail to resolve as the `locatorsByLocations` lookup in `.pnp.js`
would be using a key without a trailing slash, i.e.:

```
""../../.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

`findPackageLocator` is invoked with `location` parameter (notice no
trailing slash):

```
location = ""/home/zregvart/.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

from `resolveToUnqualified` with parameters:

```
request = ""fg-loadcss/package.json""
issuer = ""/home/zregvart/.cache/yarn/v4/npm-inline-critical-4.0.7-3ffba6a869f39215c8bb00ed2dd6b872e7f98adc/node_modules/inline-critical""
```

All starting from `loadNodeModulesSync` in `resolve`'s `sync.js`[3]
that ends up having `absoluteStart` without the trailing slash.

Not sure if this is the most correct way of fixing this issue, by just
ensuring that the trailing slash needed for the lookup is added if
missing.

All tests from `yarn test` and from `packages/pkg-tests`
`yarn jest yarn.test.js` pass, so it seems like a start.

This is how to reproduce:

package.json:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""require-failure"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""main"": ""index.js"",
  ""license"": ""MIT"",
  ""scripts"": {
    ""install"": ""node --require ./.pnp.js index.js""
  },
  ""devDependencies"": {
    ""critical"": ""^1.3.4""
  },
  ""installConfig"": {
    ""pnp"": true
  }
}
```

index.js:
```javascript
require('critical').generate({
  inline: true,
  html: '<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""site.css""></head><body><h1>Hello</h1></body></html>'
});
```

site.css:
```css
h1 { font-weight: bold; }
```

Not sure how to create a package test from that example (sorry).

**Summary**

Fixes #6439 

The chocolately install has always been full of log spam due to an incorrectly written `/l*v` flag, but those logs are also unneeded since the output has no useful info so I just removed them (this can be reversed to just fix the flag if y'all really want it back).

This also removes the bad `nodejs-lts` nuget dependency added in #5925. It now has no dependency, and instead logs out to inform the user to install node if it's missing.

The last three tests in `__tests__/commands/publish.js` were regularly timing
out locally, yet they were doing fine on CI. They were apparently running in
interactive mode, and were waiting for user input after `publish` was called
(to set the next version number).

Setting `nonInteractive` to false by default in `__tests__/commands/_helpers`
ensures that all command tests run in non-interactive mode unless otherwise
specified. This prevents this problem from occuring again, at least among the
tests that use this helper.

Note that this change won't improve tests on CI, as this problem never
affected CI. The tests were running in non-interactive mode on CI
already due to an `isCi` check in `config.js`.",False

additional network call, it broke all existing unit tests to add this feature and have it run
automatically. In the interest of getting an initial release in the hands of our users the
""add/install/upgrade"" commands accept a ""--audit"" flag that will enable the audit. If you want audit
to always execute, you can add ""--*.audit true"" to .yarnrc

For some packages the NPM registry is incorrectly returning tarball

The Webpack config was also updated in superficial ways to follow
recommendations made for migrating from Webpack v1 to v2 (e.g. using
`module.rules` instead of `module.loaders`). These changes should have no

jest-haste-map: @providesModule naming collision:
  Duplicate module name: yarn
  Paths: <repo directory>\dist\package.json collides with

This is because the Jest module system finds two copies of Yarn; the
primary package and the build output. This causes ambiguity when loading
`yarn` from a test, or a module that depends upon yarn.

Adding the build directory to `modulePathIgnorePatterns` prevents this
message. This means that if `yarn` is imported from within a test (which
it is not currently), the version found will be the primary package, not
the built version.

This seems acceptable. Currently, components of `yarn` are referenced by
filename rather than by package name, and they are all from the `src`
directory. The many cases where the built `yarn` is run in tests are all
done through a child process, where this change would not be applicable

Jest 22.4.x mocks the process object without a proper stub for `process.mainModule`. In our
lifecycle code, we try to set `env.npm_execpath` when it is not defined by using
`process.mainModule.filename`. When running tests on AppVeyor, we run Jest directly, thus we don't
have `env.npm_execpath` set, triggering the `process.mainModule` code path which is also not set,
causing tests to fail.

**Summary**
Add a case in `bin/yarn` to run `cygpath` on the yarn base dir if the environment is MSYS.

Automatic path translation happens differently, or perhaps conditionally, depending on whether msys detects the target binary is a native Win32 application or not. While bash from Git for Windows seems to treat `winpty` as a Win32 binary, the version of `winpty` which is compatible with MSYS2 does not trigger the path conversion.

**Test plan**
`yarn` executed from within bash within MSYS2 correct executes, instead of failing with a path
related error. `yarn` continues to execute correctly from within Git Bash.

**Summary**

this reverts most of #3395 992b5c9086406b57416e1b0c3c77bea894fc97f0 which appears only necessary to work around #3329 (requesting the yarn version with -v triggered install). As noted in #5839, `yarn -v` and `yarn check` no longer have `install` as a side effect and IMO, the original behavior where an empty lock file is generated as part of install is the correct behavior.

Many tools currently sniff for a yarn.lock file to determine if yarn is being used. It seems more consistent with `yarn import` which generates a lockfile even if the existing node_modules is empty.

**Summary**

1. Added node 10 to CircleCI
2. Fixed a test that was using the `net.createServer` method. This was having issues, likely because of this: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/20334 - it now uses a ""normal"" `http` server instead, serving the same purpose.
3. Changed the `readFirstAvailableStream` method in `util/fs.js`. I'm guessing this is related to the same issue as 2, but there have been quite some changes in `10` that might be causing this - so it's just a guess. Since this piece of code could be clearer and more conceise anyway, I opted to just change it. Now instead of relying on the stream `error` event to check if a file exists, it just explicitly checks it before starting the stream.
4. Upgraded `upath` from `1.0.2` to `1.0.5` which supports node 10 (found through its `engines` field when installing).
5. Upgraded Jest
6. Fixed a bug regarding replacing symlinks to non-existent targets on Windows
7. Removed a redundant test
8. Fixed two test cases that were failing frequently on macOS builds

**Summary**

A previous change removed the -c option that was passed to the shell, causing script like ""echo foo""
to fail if script-shell was set to bash. This change cleans up the way custom shell is specified,
passing the shell to node's child process spawner instead of trying to make it part of our command
string. Doing it this way seems to account for the previously required -c flag.

fixes #5699 

**Test plan**

No test was added because our tests for the `yarn run` command use a mocked `execute-lifecycle-script`. Plus these tests would get run on windows too, so making a test that specified a config of `script-shell bash` would fail if it was unmocked.

Can be tested manually by creating a `.yarnrc` that contains:

```
script-shell bash
```

and adding a script like:

```
  ""scripts"": {
    ""foo"": ""echo foo; echo bar; echo $SHELL""
  }
```

which should produce the output

```

**Summary**

Fixes #976.

This is a bug fix to the problem where lifecycle scripts that try to go interactive hang yarn installs with no indication as to why.

This sets stdin to /dev/null and, on unix-like systems, detaches the process from the terminal making it unable to read /dev/tty.

Previously with the spinner enabled was impossible to give input to an interactive script on stdin, because a pipe was kept open from the main yarn process to the child process but it was never written to.  Interactive scripts could previously use /dev/tty on unix-likes to bypass this, however the fact that scripts are run in parallel means that if two scripts go interactive in this manner that they'll step on each other.

This does not change the behavior if the spinner is disabled. Also added a simple integration test with a blocking install script that times out without the patch.

Currently, it's possible (although undocumented) to automatically bump the version by running something like `yarn version --loose-semver --new-version minor`.

**Summary**

Last year I contributed the ability to disable commit hooks when versioning with npm (See [this commit](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2dec601c6d5a576751d50efbcf76eaef4deff31e#diff-2992be03e25e9f38300b7ce175e4f4e1)). It makes sense to add the same functionality to yarn.

The original motivation for this feature is based on a pre-commit hook that included linting and testing a large code base, taking ~20 seconds to run. When that hook is run on the preceding commits, it's unnecessary and time-taking to do so on versioning. Because of that, it's nice to have the option to disable that git hook.

**Summary**

Closes #5054, closes #4876, closes #5152.

Currently when running `yarn --ignore-optional` required dependencies can be marked as optional because they exist in the tree of `optionalDependencies` of one of the dependencies (but it's required by some other non-optional dependency).

For example: `once` depends on `wrappy`, but `wrappy` is also in the chain from `fsevents` (`glob` -> `inflight` -> `wrappy`) which is an optional dependency of `chokidar`. So if the first `wrappy` comes from an ""optional chain"" when yarn processes it, it ends up being marked as `_reference.optional = true`, and the package hoister therefore doesn't mark it as required.

When running the released version of yarn with https://github.com/spalger/reproduce-issues/blob/master/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies you'll see

```
~/dev/reproduce-issues/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies
$ yarn --ignore-optional
yarn install v1.3.2-20171204.1856

yarn check v1.3.2-20171204.1856
error ""once#wrappy"" not installed
error An unexpected error occurred: ""Found 1 errors."".
```

This fix checks whether or not the parent is marked as required, and if so, marking the dependency as required _unless_ it's listed in the parent's `optionalDependencies`.

**Test plan**

I tested this implementation with both https://github.com/spalger/reproduce-issues/blob/master/yarn-ignores-non-optional-dependencies and https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4876, and in both cases `yarn check --verify-tree` succeeded after running `yarn --ignore-optional`.

fixes #4984
fixes #5327

Summary

Previously the relative path to the script to run was being passed to the child_process function, plus the cwd was being set. This caused relative paths to be doubled.

For example if the current process.cwd() is /projects/sampleProject/subdir and you execute yarn --cwd .. run test then it would attempt to run the command

../node_modules/.bin/test

from

/projects/sampleProject

which is incorrect.

The fix here was to use path.resolve instead of .join to convert the script's location to an absolute path.

Test plan

Tested manually.

I tried to write a unit test for this, but under the current test framework an absolute dir was always passed to the script execution because config.cwd is always set to the absolute path for the test fixture.

Trying to set the config.cwd to a relative path causes tests to fail because they become relative to where yarn run test was executed (the root of the Yarn project).

**Summary**
Yarn already supports aliasing a scoped package with an unscoped package:
```bash

This PR adds support for aliasing any package with a scoped package:

* fix(install): use node-gyp from homebrew npm

**Summary**

With this yarn will be able to discover and use the node-gyp from the
homebrew installed npm on macOS instead of falling back to globally
installing node-gyp every time a native addon needs to be compiled from
source.

Homebrew installs a clean copy of npm inside a libexec folder together
with node.
Previously yarn didn't look there when trying to locate node-gyp and the
globally install node-gyp fallback would be used every time when
building native addons with a yarn version from homebrew.
This PR adds the libexec path of node-gyp from homebrew to the node-gyp
search paths of yarn, making it possible to compile native addons using
the homebrew npm provided node-gyp with yarn without relying on this
fallback.

**Test plan**

This can't be tested outside a homebrew environment.

A way to manually test this on macOS, by installing a test build of this
PR with homebrew and trying to install a native addon with it, is
provided in the PR description.

This test asserts that bin links from direct dependencies are installed.

* Do not overwrite existing bin links

The bin links are created in two passes during install. In the first

dependencies are created in their respective bin directories. In the

transient dependencies.

      Hashes don't match when extracting file

The problem was that yarn was writing both `@types/react-15.6.4.tgz` and `react-15.6.4.tgz` to the same location within the offline mirror due to making an assumption about no additional leading paths before the scope name in the URL -- an assumption which was true for registry.npmjs.org, but not for artifactory npm repositories.

**Summary**

Fixes #4978

Previously, there was logic in add command that [uses user-specified range out of the box](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/add.js#L71-L72), resulting in the issue above. For example, if the user ran `yarn add left-pad@1.0.0` the pattern parser skipped `--exact` or `--tilde flags`, as well as saved prefix config options.

This change updates it so that if the user specifies a valid numeric version, then these flags still have an effect. These cases don't cover `yarn add left-pad@~1.0.0` or `yarn add left-pad@^1.0.0` since I think the confusion only arises from when the user enters `exact` pattern (just the number).

**Summary**

This adds the additional warning if there are no bin scripts or if there are no scripts available. If no scripts are available, scripts will not be listed.

I created this pull request when running `yarn run` without any scripts specified, yarn would try to ask the user to specify which script.

To view this feature in the CLI, run `yarn run` inside a project without any bin or scripts available.
For example:
```bash
$ yarn run
yarn run v1.3.2
error No command specified.
error There are no binary scripts available.
error There are no scripts specified inside package.json.
Done in 0.13s.

**Summary**

Fixes #4885. In #4761 I started always passing the proxy to the `request` library to prevent it from falling back to env vars HTTPS_PROXY and HTTP_PROXY. At the time I thought that Yarn would pick up these env vars through its config system and pass them down itself.

Partial resolution for #4543.

This PR adds the workspace root

**Summary**

[config.js](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/389e02979a1ffe803ab95cbea1ad7b6bcdfa42a7/src/config.js#L336) determines if yarn runs in a production environment and sets a `production` config variable accordingly. The list command wants to know if it runs in a production environment and uses `isProduction()` to do so, which does look at environment variables, slightly different than the code in `config.js`, leading to inconsistencies in some corner cases. It should just use `config.production` instead.

`isProduction()` isn't used anywhere else and `config.production` should always be preferred, so I removed the whole function. I planned to adapt the tests of `isProduction()` for `config.production`, but the [existing tests](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/389e02979a1ffe803ab95cbea1ad7b6bcdfa42a7/__tests__/integration.js#L82) for `config.production` already cover all those cases.

**Summary**

Use `boolifyWithDefault()` to determine if environment variable values are `true` or `false`. This ensures that all environment variables interpret the same values the same way.

This changes the behavior of `YARN_SILENT` and `YARN_IGNORE_PATH` if they have ""unexpected"" values, all nonempty stings beside `""0""` and `""false""` are now interpreted as `true`. For example `YARN_SILENT=hello` was interpreted as `false` before, now it is `true`. This makes some sense since those values are truthy in Javascript, but generally makes things more predictable if it works like that for all yarn environment variables.

`YARN_SILENT=true` was also interpreted as `false`. This now definitely makes more sense since it will be interpreted as `true`.

**Summary**

Fixes #4778.

In this particular issue, the same pattern `babel-runtime@^6.26.0` was [defined in both devDependencies](https://github.com/kompot/yarn-frozen-lockfile-bug/blob/master/package.json#L80) and [resolutions field](https://github.com/kompot/yarn-frozen-lockfile-bug/blob/master/package.json#L130). Since resolutions feature was only intended for nested dependencies, it previously didn't take into account when the same exact pattern existed as a top level dependency. And it happens so that after the package resolver phase, [integrity checker looks at top level patterns](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/integrity-checker.js#L364-L367), so install failed.

The solution was to add top level raw patterns to resolutions map, and only remove them if they're transitive patterns

Fixes #4735

Upgrade was calling outdated in a way that would not filter packages that did not need
an upgrade. The led to potential backdate of package if a beta version was in use. Yarn would
backdate to the ""older"" latest.

Summary

Some older upgrade code I had written had a code path to have getOutdatedPackages() return all packages, not just ones that were actually outdated. My belief had been that it wouldn't cause an issue because upgrading to the same version would just do nothing... but it turns out if you are on a beta version of a package, this would cause upgrade --latest to backdate you to the actual latest.

So for example if you were currently at beta 1.0.3-0 and the registry had latest 1.0.1 then yarn upgrade --latest would backdate you to 1.0.1.

This PR reinstates the filter that only returns versions if the current is less-than the latest, which would in the above example leave the user at 1.0.3-0

**Summary**

Looking at two solutions introduced in #3393 and #3756, the first one doesn't support win32, while the second does, sticking with the second one more beneficial and supports a wider range of OS.

Removed the stuff introduced in #3393 keeping only #3756.

#3756 also introduced config file normalization, so probably second argument to getOption is obsolete, will discover that and submit another PR if that's the case.

**Summary**

Fixes #4546. Previous behavior was that if `.npmrc` or `.yarnrc` contained and `http-proxy` but not an `https-proxy`, HTTPS requests would ""fall back"" to the `http-proxy`.

This is not always the desired behavior; See #4546 sometimes one protocol needs a proxy and the other does not.

This PR adds the ability to set the `https-proxy` to `false` which will cause Yarn to not use an HTTPS proxy (and not fall-back to the HTTP proxy). This allows the code to treat `undefined` as the setting not being specified (which will fall back to http-proxy) and `false` as the setting being specified, but set to false (which will not use a proxy).

**Summary**

This addresses some of the windows issues regarding running yarn in gitbash and friends envrionment.
with this fix I keep the behavior introduced 5 months ago in yarnpkg/yarn#3245, but try to do a better job detecting when to use winpty out of the box, in order make `piping` of output work with yarn.

Before this fix:
```shell
$ yarn --version
1.1.0
$ yarn --version | cat
1.1.0
$ yarn init
yarn init v1.1.0
error An unexpected error occurred: ""Can't answer a question unless a user TTY"".
info If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in ""D:\\workspace\\yarn\\yarn-error.log"".
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/init for documentation about this command.
```

Piping works for simple commands, but interactive commands only work with an environment set to something. This prohibits scripts/tools around yarn that uses pipe, which is quite common to do in an unix like environment, but theses tools cannot work in windows' unix like environment.

WinPTY seems to be the savior here, but we need to only run yarn through winpty when a tty actually needs to be allocated. 

Previous attempts to solve this problem like: 
- yarnpkg/yarn#2230
- yarnpkg/yarn#2243

Did not address the use cases of piping, so they essentially broke that behavior.
Then yarnpkg/yarn#3245 fixed that, but now you have to use `YARN_FORCE_WINPTY=1` environment variable in order for `yarn init` and `yarn upgrade-interactive` to work and that's alright, but if you export that variable then piping is broken yet again because the variable will also be set in the piped command, and we haven't solved any problem.

I suggest we keep the environment variable behavior but open up for better detection when to use winpty out of the box.

This fix detects if the winpty binary is in path, and only use it if stdin is in fact a TTY: `test -t 1`. 

**Test plan**

The output of running:
- `yarn init`
- `yarn upgrade-interactive`
- `yarn --version | cat`

Without having the `YARN_FORCE_WINPTY=1` environment variable set.

the `dnscache` module which intercepts all DNS look ups and answers
them from an in-memory cache when possible. This applies to the

A combination of changes have caused `yarn upgrade-interactive` to exit with a promise rejection.

The child rejection inside of [upgrade-interactive](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/upgrade-interactive.js#L152) is fine, as it was handled by the `Promise.race` condition; however, rejecting at the parent level inside of [console-reporter](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/reporters/console/console-reporter.js#L458) causes[ loud-rejection](https://github.com/sindresorhus/loud-rejection) to handle this.

**Summary**
Fix for https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4357.

The issue is that when a dependency (dep A) defined in resolutions (includes dep A, dep B) depends on another resolution (dep B), then it expects to match its own nested dep B to the top level resolution dep B. So the first part of this fix is ""don't run resolutions map check when it's in flat mode"", which is what threw the invariant warning. Second part of the fix is that we still want that nested dependency (dep B) of a resolution (dep A) to be resolved correctly. `--flat` mode solves this by [collapsing all versions](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/cli/commands/install.js#L558) after the resolver is done. For resolutions, I'm adding a delay queue for requests with resolutions but no manifests found yet so that they will be resolved later.

* Fix: Make sure global prefix folder is writeable when selecting it

**Summary**

Fixes #4320 and fixes #4323. We were using `fs.access` when selecting
the global prefix folder automatically which only checks for permissions
but not actual writeability. This caused issues on Heroku where one of
our first tries had the correct permissions but was on a read-only
file system.

**Test plan**

Existing cache folder fallback tests should be enough for now. We should
move the core of those tests for the newly added `fs.getFirstWriteableFolder`
method.

Fixes #4251. Follow up to #4088. Instead of just checking whether the
target is a valid directory, we now check if it contains a
`package.json` file too. This is still different from `npm`'s behavior.
Apparently, `npm` fetches the package info upfront to favor dist-tags
over directories but this comes at a distinct performance penalty and
makes static, deterministic resolution impossible so we are now
deprecating the implicit `file:` protocol in patterns. After a certain
point, we'll remove this code and will require everyone to use `file:`

**Summary**

This PR prevents using `yarn add <pkg>` from within a workspace root folder, in order to prevent common mistakes where a package is added to the workspace root folder instead of being added to the right workspace (which, because of the node resolution algorithm, would be effectively invisible to the user).

If the user really wants to add a dependency to the workspace root folder, then we suggest them to use `yarn add <pkg> --dev` instead. This should be fine since the workspaces will probably only be used in development mode anyway. An alternative would be to introduce a new flag `--force` that would bypass this check, but I think the current heuristic is fine until we receive complaints.

Fixes: #3954.

Adds error handling for scripts that are failing with a signal such as `SIGBUS`, `SIGSEGV`, etc.

**Summary**

There's a delay between when we make sure a file in cache exists and when we actually start reading it. Our code wasn't doing any error handling when trying to open the file so if another process removes the file we assume existing we were throwing an unexpected `ENOENT ... open` error.

This patch removes all delayed existence checks and catches the error directly on the `ReadStream` instance directly. Moreover, it automatically falls back for local caches: direct, cache, offline mirror.

This revealed a bug in tarball path resolution which I fixed.

**Summary**
Fixes: #3907.

In yarn version 0.27.4 a patch (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/commit/5ff69228f6cc9fa27bbaeb67412f7f66f218b9da) introduced a change that caused an authorization header to be added to requests that were not being sent to the registry.

This commit brings back some older logic to ensure we only add the authorization header when we are sending requests to the registry.

**Test plan**

Many new unit tests for requests and `isRequestToRegistry`.

To test this change you need a private repository using a repository server such, as Verdaccio configured, to only allow authenticated calls to be made for both download and publish commands. This configuration requires that yarn has the `always-auth` option enabled.

If we install additional packages from GitHub and save them to the `yarn.lock` file it should not send the authorization header for these requests.",False

**Summary**

For git dependencies, the branch/tag resolution does not always work as expected.
Refactor the code to make the resolution algorithm more explicit and follow discussions in #3720.

**Test plan**

New test in `__tests__/util/git-ref-resolver.js`.

Also, benefit from the fact that Travis CI ran the test with an older Git version. I don't know if we have a minimum git version requirement, it seems we currently don't test against any specific version.

**Implementation details**

I refactored `parseRefs` to return the full ref name, so we can differentiate branches and tags.

I use `git ls-remote --symref` to get the default branch name. This works only in recent versions of git (thanks Travis CI for reporting the issue), so I fall back to another algorithm if `--symref` is unavailable.

I tried not to use the variable name `hash`, which is confusing between the git-url hash and the commit hash.",False

**Summary**

Refs #3524. We are using `process.exit()` pretty liberally although it is [strongly advised not to use it](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_exit_code) since it may cause the `stdout` to get corrupted/terminated before a full flush. This patch changes all possible `process.exit(code)` calls with `process.exitCode = code` statements.

We'd also ideally enable [no-process-exit](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-process-exit) rule in ESLint but it requires an upgrade to ESLint v4 which should be handled separately.

- Fix `link/unlink` test's race condition and previous test case reliance
- Fix `request-manager` timeout tests to be more reliable and finish in under our normal timeout
- Use real timers by default and add necessary `useFakeTimers` calls

from `tar-fs` when creating a package to upload and put that stream

`stream.Transform` and nothing was reading back from it, it had the
potential to just hang there until something reads from it. This

**Summary**

Fixes #764.

Turns out when fetching packages from remote sources via Git,
it may ask for a username or password and get stuck there since
we run it in the background. This patch passes the following env
variables to disable any prompts:

1. `$GIT_ASKPASS=""""`
   This is the command Git runs to get username and pass. Setting
   it to an empty string disables it and git exits with an error.
2. `$GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`
    This is new in Git 2.3 and it prevents git from even trying to
    ask for a password. Surpasses `$GIT_ASKPASS` above.
3. `$GIT_SSH_COMMAND=""ssh -oBatchMode=yes""`
    This is also new in Git 2.3 and it makes git make the call to
    ssh via this command. `BatchMode=yes` option tells ssh to not
    do anything interactive (because batch/script mode) like
    password prompts in case publickey auth fails etc.

* fs: do bulk file reads to optimize cache extraction

This patch boosts cache extraction by ~2x+ by letting node
do more parallelization work. This makes nearly all of the file copy
stuff be done by the C++ code with minimal boundary-crossing (at least
compared to node streams).

Streams in node.js are ~3x slower, specially for small files,
than just doing fs.writeFile/readFile, because of this boundary. This
is something Yarn might want to take into account in other places.

The reason this is OK is because pretty much any files this would
handle would fit neatly into memory (any npm packages MUST fit
into memory by definition, because of the way npm@<5 does extracts).

If you really want to make doubleplus sure to minimize memory usage,
you could do an fs.stat to find the file size and then do heuristics
to only use streams for files bigger than <X>MB.

* Allow prerelease versions when checking peer deps

Uses lower-level APIs in node-semver to allow prerelease versions when checking peer deps. This honors the intent of library authors e.g. when they write a React component that asks for `""react"": "">=15.0.0""` they're saying OK with `react@16.0.0` (partly because the React team specifically has said that if you don't have any warnings in version N, then version N+1 should work for you). By extension and modulo bugs, `react@16.0.0-alpha` works too (if the user explicitly installs it).

Test Plan: Added unit tests for the new semver utility.

Tested in a real project that uses React 16.0.0-alpha.11 and verified I didn't get any peer dep warnings that usually appear from libraries that ask for `""react"": "">=15.0.0""`. Downgraded React to 0.14.0 (too low) and saw peer dep warnings come back as expected.

* Tighten up upper bounds so that ""2.0.0-pre"" doesn't match ""^1.0.0""

node-semver converts ~ and ^ ranges into pairs of >= and < ranges but the upper bounds don't properly exclude prerelease versions. For example, ""^1.0.0"" is converted to "">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"", which includes ""2.0.0-pre"" since prerelease versions are lower than their non-prerelease counterparts. As a practical workaround we make upper-bound ranges exclude prereleases and convert ""<2.0.0"" to ""<2.0.0-0"", for example.

* When testing `yarn pack`, use fs.walk instead of fs.readdir

This ensures that files inside directories are listed too.

* Add failing test for packing directories recursively

https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2498

* `pack`: include contents of directories in `files` field

This makes it so that you don't have to put '/**' after a directory in
the `files` field of package.json to ensure that the contents of the
directory will be published.

* `path` test: Make output easier to understand

Now, we can see just what the expected/actual difference is, rather than
just getting a -1 vs 0 from an indexOf test.

* `pack`: transform each [ ""file-name"" ] into [ ""file-name"", ""file-name/**"" ], whether it's a file or a folder

This is a mitigation for issue #2629.
In some cases two different packages could end up unpacking into the same cache folder.
Example https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2629#issuecomment-282745896, package typescript is downloaded twice because yarn.lock has inconsistent entries.
This change prevents more than one package to be unpacked into the same cache folder.

This is not a final fix for #2629, there is a more specific bug in resolver that causes this internal inconsistency but I think fetcher should check that every package will be extracted in a unique folder anyway.

Test Plan:
- I'll add a unit test in the next PR when I'll be fixing the reason for the same package having 2 downloads
- Manual test plan

Instead of including all the raw JS files in the dist tarball, just use the single Yarn JS file that's built as part of the build, along with a few other files that are required. This significantly reduces the number of files in the tarball:

```
C:\src\yarn\dist (bundle-as-dist) (yarn@0.23.0-0)
λ find .
.
./bin
./bin/node-gyp-bin
./bin/node-gyp-bin/node-gyp
./bin/node-gyp-bin/node-gyp.cmd
./bin/yarn
./bin/yarn.cmd
./bin/yarn.js
./bin/yarnpkg
./bin/yarnpkg.cmd
./lib
./lib/v8-compile-cache.js
./lib/yarn-cli.js
./LICENSE
./package.json
```

There are three .js files in the archive:
 - `lib/v8-compile-cache.js`:  Speeds up instantiation time by using the V8 code cache (https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-compile-cache). This needs to be separate as it has to load **before** the bulk of the application code is loaded, so it can **not** be bundled
 - `lib/yarn-cli.js`: Contains all the bundled Yarn code
 - `bin/yarn.js`: Entry point to the app, just like today. Loads `v8-compile-cache` then loads `yarn-cli`

This change means that **only** the JavaScript files that are actually used are included, resulting in a nice file size reduction for the installation packages:
![](http://ss.dan.cx/2017/04/Yarn_bundle_dist_metrics_-_Google_Sheets_-_Google__01-13.51.49.png)

Differences are due to differing compression algorithms: Debian packages use xz or LZMA, RedHat uses gzip, Windows installer uses Cabinet

They're also slightly faster to extract:
![image 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/91933/24582332/483b41f4-16e2-11e7-9509-8024b1e78a39.png)

Testing was performed on my desktop computer (Intel Core i5 6500, Samsung 850 Evo 1TB SSD, Windows 10), with testing for Linux stuff (like installing the Debian package) tested in a Docker container.

Raw data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d8jdf3DU_GUFdotlPl08PkYa8SkzStK2tgnQ54ivsm0/edit?usp=sharing

Performance is very slightly faster when using `v8-compile-cache` along with the bundled file, but it's not extremely significant (`yarn --version` went from 0.19s to 0.14s on my BuyVM server). The difference might be bigger on servers with slower disks (HDD) or with more overloaded servers.

This PR opens the way to share configuration between multiple projects via the use of the .yarnrc
files. The current design it pretty simple: it simply adds the supported options from the yarnrc file at the beginning of the command line.

Some notes:

The yarnrc is currently parsed synchronously. I believe this is not an issue, since it's quite literally the very first thing we need to do when booting the application (even before the command line can be parsed), so there's really nothing we could run concurrently anyway.

The yarnrc is read in another file (https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/registries/yarn-registry.js). I haven't changed how it works there, since I wanted my first draft to have as few changes as possible, but it's something that should probably be fixed so that the code only use one path to manage the yarnrc files.",False

Summary

This PR expands internal implementation of integrity check functionality.

.yarn-integrity file now contains all the properties as exploded JSON instead of sha-1 hashed.
This makes it easier to debug issues with integrity checks and installations

.yarn-integrity now contains list of files in node_modules if install/add command has --check-files flag passed.
When check command is executing it will have an option to test that files exist on disk.
This makes the command useful to identify when node_modules gets partially removed.

To use the new file checking feature:

yarn install --check-files
yarn check --integrity --check-files
This is an opt-in feature so people should not be affected buy it yet.
In the next iteration we may consider making --check-files the default option.
Also we may want to reevaluate other flags in check command and end up with more semantic/self explanatory options.

Exploded .yarn-integrity and especially files field allows us to integrate with third-party tools that may need list of files before yarn install is executed (e.g. BUCK).
Also it allows us to make a quick integrity check without loading much of the Yarn internals - only check that lock files entries are present, flags are the same and folders exist.",False

There was a conflict when commander attempts to parse the incoming args

was shared. In other words, executing the command `yarn version`
would yield the same output as `yarn --version`. This relates to PR #2268.

Relating to tj/commander.js#346, when an arg shares the same name as an

to 'yarn --version'. This logic can subsequently be removed once this issue is resolved.",False

Currently, when you have interconnected file dependencies, yarn install
fails after a lockfile has been generated. This failure occurs because
we call split on the package's resolved url, which is undefined. This fix
makes sure we have a resolved url before trying to call split on it.

For example, you have a project that has only two dependencies, a and b.
Both are local files. Package a depends on b, and b has no dependencies.
You can run yarn install from a clean state without issue. This generates
a lock file. Running yarn install a second time fails. This issue fixes
that.

This makes yarn link work when $HOME/.config/yarn/link/ is itself a symlink.

----

The following commit forces symlinks to be relative:
https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/commit/36d73cc3bb0e3c4afcea4f25b06cc76b7b5531fa

This isn't ideal, although it enables some portability it breaks others.
For example, it is not uncommon for `$HOME/.config` itself to be be a
symlink: `$HOME/.config` -> `$HOME/src/stefanpenner/dotfiles`.

Now when running `yarn link` inside `$HOME/src/ember-cli/ember-cli` we
end up with:

```js
path.relative('/Users/spenner/.config/yarn/link/ember-cli',
'/Users/spenner/src/ember-cli/ember-cli');
=> '../../../src/ember-cli/ember-cli'
```

Which results in the link located at:
`/Users/spenner/.config/yarn/link/ember-cli` pointing to
`/Users/spenner/.config/src/ember-cli/ember-cli` rather then
`/Users/spenner/src/ember-cli/ember-cli`

This is because `/Users/spenner/.config` is actually a symlink pointing
to `/Users/spenner/src/stefanpenner/dotfiles/.config/`

* Fix request authentication for scoped private registry tarballs

Yarn correctly sends authorization headers when resolving metadata, but
when it's time to download the tarballs, it calls registry.request
with a full tarball url. This causes the getRegistry() function to
incorrectly return the DEFAULT_REGISTRY url which means the authorization
headers are no longer sent. The response in this case is a JSON error
object instead of a tarball file. Untaring fails with ""invalid tar file""

* Use built-in `stream.Transform` to create `HashStream`s

Since we're only targeting newer Node versions with a reasonable stream module, and we can use the `class` syntax sugar, it makes sense to extend `stream.Transform` directly to create a `HashStream`. In a future commit, this will allows to remove `through2` altogether.
