## Description
Projects using newer versions of sass which have deprecated `lighten()`
will get deprecation warnings.

This updates sass, and switches to `color.adjust()`. This function is
available since dart sass 1.23.0.

Note this would increase the output CSS size, as it will output
different colour syntax, .e.g.

```
<   background-image: linear-gradient(-180deg, #fff 88%, rgb(114.9141509434, 132.7028301887, 159.3858490566) 100%);
---
>   background-image: linear-gradient(-180deg, #fff 88%, #73859f 100%);

## Description
On desktop, a user can hover over the progress bar while content plays,
which makes it possible to seek to a relatively precise location without
disrupting playback. On mobile there is no hovering, so in order to seek
during inline playback the user can only tap a location on the progress
bar (very hard to do precisely on a small screen) or scrub to try to
hone in on a specific location (can be very clunky because seeks are
constantly being executed). This PR adds a feature to treat scrubbing on
mobile more like hovering on desktop-- while scrubbing, seeks are
disabled and playback continues, only when the user finishes scrubbing
is a single seek executed to the desired location.

One key use-case for this feature is thumbnail seeking integrations on
mobile, where the user can scrub through different thumbnail images
until they find their desired seek location.

## Specific Changes proposed
This behavior is similar to the existing `enableSmoothSeeking` behavior
in that the `PlayProgressBar` slider visibly updates with the scrubbing
movements, but differs in a few ways:
- Playback continues while scrubbing, no seeks are executed until
`touchend`.
- The seek bar's `TimeTooltip` component displays the target seek time
while scrubbing, rather than the `CurrentTimeDisplay` (which continues
to show the current time of the playing content).",False

## Specific Changes proposed
Add new methods-- `addSourceElement()` and `removeSourceElement()` to
the player and tech. The former will take a source object and create and
append a new `<source>` element to the `<video>` element, and the latter
will take a source url and remove any `<source>` element with a matching
`src`.

## Description
By default a Video.js player has an ErrorDisplay, but in the event it is
created without one, an error will be thrown when starting spatial
navigation.

## Specific Changes proposed
Only add an event listener to `player.errorDisplay` if it exists.

## Description
The current implementation of `requestNamedAnimationFrame` prevents
multiple updates on a frame but by disregarding all but the first
request per frame. This throttling behaviour is apparent when playing a
very short video - if a `timeupdate` occurs just before the `ended`
event, the progress bar position on the `timeupdate` is set at say 98%
and 100% from the `ended` is discarded. Although #8633 removed the
throttle from the `ended` handler itself, the throttle and non-throttled
update can still both execute between frames.

## Specific Changes proposed
Changes the implementation to apply only the last callback instead. If
any exist they will be cancelled. There will still be only one update,
but now it's the last.
Updates tests to reflect the changed behaviour. 
Fixes #8782

## Description
tsc doesn't understand mixins and ignores jsdoc not followed by code.
The jsdoc for the plugin methods `usingPlugin()` and `hasPlugin()` in
Player are being ignored. To get them included in type outputs we need
to have otherwise unnecessary stubs codes, as we already have for `on()`
etc, which adds unnecessary, even if a small amount of, code to the
outputs.

## Specific Changes proposed
* Slight refactor of Player to include those stubs.
* Adds a rollup plugin to delete lines between certain comments, so
those stubs are deleted from the outputs.
* Applies those comments to the `on()` etc stubs in Component and the
new plugin stubs in Player.

Any code surrounded by these comments, and the comments themselves, is
deleted from the dist and test builds:

```js
/* start-delete-from-build */
  console.log('hi');
/* start-delete-from-build */
```

Compared to main, video.min.js is 53 bytes smaller.

## Description
Chrome 53 doesn't like the minified output. Specifically, it throws
`Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (` on the ternary in the
minified version of `normalizeListenArgs()`

https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/e78bcc7b2d829fce01451cf105b918d8feec4548/src/js/mixins/evented.js#L165-L195

Line breaks added for clarify

```js
Tt = (e, t, s) => {
  var i = t.length < 3 || t[0] === e || t[0] === e.eventBusEl_;
  let r, n, a;
  return i ? (r = e.eventBusEl_, 3 <= t.length && t.shift(), [n, a] = t) : [r, n, a] = t, ft(r, e, s), yt(n, e, s), bt(a, e, s), a = _(e, a), {
    isTargetingSelf: I,
    target: r,
    type: n,
    listener: a
  }
},
```

Chrome would be happy with this if `[r, n, a] = t` were `([r, n, a] =
t)`.

## Specific Changes proposed
Refactor `normalizeListenArgs()` slightly to use multiple statements to
coerce uglify-js to include parentheses.
Also updates uglify-js, but that in itself isn't the fix.

- Removes erroneous `@return {Component}` from `ReadyCallback` in

- Remove `@this {Component}` from `ReadyCallback` in Component, because
this is not accurate for classes that extend Component
- Adds `@returns {void}` to `ReadyCallback` in Component
  - Produces a more accurate typedef
- Isn't strictly accurate in jsdoc/javascript but does this matter since
it's well understood. Absence of `@return` is interpreted by tsc as
returning `{any}`, `@returns {undefined}` would require an explicit
`return undefined` in ts.
- Adds a `{PlayerReadyCallback}` in Player with `@this {Player}` used in
the `new Player()` and `videos()` constructors.
  - Are we ok adding this new typedef
- Is inconsistent with `player.ready()` which uses `ReadyCallback`
without `@this` - but this can't be changed without adding an otherwise
unnecessary override just to pander to tsc.

## Description
Typescript =< 5.2 generated better types for `log` than >= 5.3. We're on
5.5 as that has the better import syntax.
Changing createLogger to use `function log()` rather than `const log =
function()` outputs as before.

Also updates typescript to 5.5.1 (rc) from 5.5.0 (beta).

5.2, or 5.5 with this change
```
export default log;
declare const log: {
    (...args: any[]): void;
    createLogger(subName: string, subDelimiter?: string, subStyles?: string): any;
    createNewLogger(newName: string, newDelimiter?: string, newStyles?: string): any;
    levels: any;
    level(lvl?: ""info"" | ""error"" | ""all"" | ""debug"" | ""warn"" | ""off""): string;
    history: {
        (): any[];
        filter(fname: string): any[];
        clear(): void;
        disable(): void;
        enable(): void;
    };
    error(...args: any[]): any;
    warn(...args: any[]): any;
    debug(...args: any[]): any;
};
export const createLogger: (subName: string, subDelimiter?: string, subStyles?: string) => any;
//# sourceMappingURL=log.d.ts.map%
```

5.3+, without this change
```
export default log;
declare function log(...args: any[]): void;
declare namespace log { }
export const createLogger: (subName: string, subDelimiter?: string, subStyles?: string) => any;
//# sourceMappingURL=log.d.ts.map%
```

The fix for the previous issue with the new text track settings
introduced that ids would be re-used across players as there was no
prefix for the settings that don't have a `<label>` for their
`<select>`.

This change uses a generated guid for items without that label.

https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming/pull/1408 updated 608 captions to default to be left aligned. This may be unwanted by some folks and we should provide an easier way to force them to be centered.
This PR adds a player level class that will override the text alignment to be `center`. It also overrides the `width` to `80%` because otherwise the cue box isn't set up correctly to be 10% from the right of the display area (a side effect of hardcoding a width value and using inset in the generation of the cues).",False

so, that we do that check as early as possible. Also, we should
default this property to `false` in this case, so, that we assume we
can't until we confirm we can.

Audio Tracks are supposed to allow multiple tracks at the same time.
Safari 15 has added, at least partial support for this.

In #7163, we stopped turning other tracks of manually since we already
were doing so in the AudioTrackList. However, this only worked for
non-native AudioTracks. Before Safari 15, Safari automatically turned
off the other tracks for us so things continued to work.

With this change, when native audio tracks are used, we will turn off
the other tracks, partially reverting #7163.

these proxy tracks. Adding such tests will take too long for not a lot
of benefit, unfortunately.

If multiple `mouseenter` events fire on the controlBar before a `mouseleave` event occurs, the cached inactivityTimeout value will get overwitten with a 0. This prevents the control bar from being hidden when the inactivity timeout is reached because the hide call is skipped when inactivityTimeout <= 0.

The progress control is updated inside of requestAnimationFrames (rAFs). Normally, this is fine. However, when a tab is hidden, rAFs are generally not triggered. So, what happens is that we get a cached rAF from the last time the tab was active. When we come back to be active, we update again, but because we already have a named rAF, we don't clear it out and instead that one gets triggered. This isn't an issue if the video is still playing, because in a second, another rAF will be triggered which will update things. However, if the video has ended, we won't get any more updated and the progress bar will still be in the old position.

Instead, when the document becomes hidden, we should clear out both the SeekBar#update and the Slider#update rAFs. Doing just one, unfortunately, isn't enough. In addition, we also only re-enable the interval if we aren't ended or paused and ignore the update method if the tab is hidden.

For whatever reason, when the font size for text tracks is changed in
the text track settings dialog, we set a bottom of 2px on the cue.
This was added as part of the initial vtt work for Video.js in
https://github.com/videojs/video.js/commit/4e5c28cc561487ff29394d19dce3a420675e4f9d#diff-8169d53aa7eee6cab5f85b6641ef3117R176.
However, this doesn't seem to be doing anything right now and having it
means that when font-size is changed, multiple cues end up with a button
value of 2px causing them to overlap and obscure each other.

This works fine if the cues are positioned away from each other,
however, if multiple cues are positioned by default and a large font
size is used, while they will now stay on their lines, they may
partially obscure each other. This does not fix that issue and may
require modification (addition of overrides) to vtt.js to properly
support.",False

From my understand, in the changes #5773, the Y position of all the
boxes is already calculated and accounted for in the offsetY value we
get. However, because the HTML coordinate system has Y=0 at the top,
when we do offsetY/boxH, we get a position relative to the top of the
element. However, we expect that position relative to the ""start"" of the

It seems we have never triggered change events on remoteTextTrack when we were using native text tracks. This was a problem for VHS, which exclusively uses text tracks.
This makes it so we do trigger the event. Main issue with this change is that it creates a potential for a false positive where a change event was triggered from a non-remote text track but the remoteTextTrack list still received a change event. This issue is mitigated by best practices of looping through the list looking for the modes that you care about.

Reimplementation of https://github.com/videojs/video.js/pull/2192
on current code. Seems to work but has not been carefully tested,
especially on conditions such as slow networks and complex tracks.

For https://github.com/videojs/video.js/issues/5252

A `preloadTextTracks` tech option is added, set to true by default,
to keep current behavior intact. Alternate behavior can be enabled
by setting this to false.

This delays loading of the VTT cue files until they are selected.
For sites like Wikipedia that tend to have large numbers of
crowdsourced subtitles and can show many files together on one
page, this saves a lot of unnecessary network transfer and API
hits.

Does mean there may be dropped cues while switching to a track
that requires on-demand loading.

Example usage:

videojs(element, {
  html5: {
    preloadTextTracks: false
  }
};",False

revert the change. In addition, looking at Polymer 2 and 3, they
recommend against using the tap gesture.

Instead, we should just not update the play progress when the document is hidden. Besides solving the issue in IE11, it makes sense to do as no one could be seeing the progress bar. In addition, update() is now a no-op if the seek-bar element isn't visible.

The desired behavior when navigating any of the TimeDisplay components (current time, duration, remaining time) with the arrow keys with a screen reader is for the singular parent div to receive focus, and the reader should announce the text of each child span in order, ex. ""Current Time 0:17"" and ""Duration 1:10"". This is how it works when using JAWS. However, with VoiceOver each individual child span element receives focus and the contents are announced separately.

According to the ARIA spec (see [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#details-id-124) and [example 8](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#presentation)), there is no implicit role for span elements, so the contents should be exposed but the elements themselves should be invisible to screen readers. In other words, <span> Sample Content </span> should be the same as <span role=""presentation""> Sample Content </span>. But this is not the case with VoiceOver. As far as I can tell, the desired behavior is only achieved with VoiceOver if each child span is explicitly made presentational, either by assigning each of them the presentation role, or by assigning the parent div a role that makes its children presentational (although there doesn't seem to be a role whose semantics fit the purpose of that div)

The first ARIA doc link above shows the Mac OS X Accessibility Protocol mapping for span elements is to the group role. I don't know enough about accessibility API mapping to confidently draw conclusions about root cause, but this seems like a possible explanation.

Changes:
* add role=""presentation"" to each of the two span elements inside TimeDisplay divs
* add aria-hidden=""true to the TimeDivider (tangential improvement)
* fix inaccurate description of the TimeDisplay component (tangential improvement)",False

Move the aria-live attribute to the control text element within buttons, rather than on the whole button, so it is not affected by the change of the title attribute, only by the change of the control text.

It seems like having aria-live on the button itself means that JAWS and NVDA announce the button both when the button text changes and when the title attribute changes. NVDA speaks the new label more times because it announces the button text as the label and the title as the description, so it says, for example, ""pause button pause"". JAWS doesn't appear to do this, so it doesn't repeat it as many times.

SourceHandlers that use MSE have a problem: if they push a segment into a SourceBuffer and then seek close to the end, playback will stall and/or there will be a massive downswitch in quality. The general approach to fixing this that was discussed on slack was by setting the playback rate of the player to zero, buffering all that was required, and then restoring the previous playback rate. In my implementation, I've done this in the source handler (see: videojs/videojs-contrib-hls#1374).

From the video.js perspective, it should ensure that the UI reflects the buffering status and that the player API behaves like you'd expect -- that is to say, that it will fire seeking immediately after a call to currentTime, and it will fire seeked, canplay, canplaythrough, and playing when everything is buffered.",False

Right now the durationchange event is throttled with the other two events, timeupdate and loadedmetadata. This means that only one of those events will trigger an update if they all occur within 25ms of each other.

This functionality makes sense for timeupdate or loadedmetadata as those should not indicate a time update (even though they often do).

For durationchange however it will always indicate a change in the duration, and we want to always update the display when it happens. Here is a scenario of how we could show duration incorrectly right now:

User is playing a video that has a postroll ad at the end. After the postroll ad their will be a timeupdate, and then a durationchange to signify that we are back in content. Then ended will fire, and no more events will happen.

The player will still show the duration of the ad, as the durationchange was eaten by the timeupdate that happened at nearly the same time.

We added a feature so that remote text tracks can auto-removed when a source changes. However, in 6.x we changed the source behavior to be asynchronous meaning that some text tracks were accidentally being removed when they weren't supposed to be.
For example:
```js
var player = videojs('my-player');
player.src({src: 'video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4'});
 // set second arg to false so that they get auto-removed on source change
player.addRemoteTextTrack({kind: 'captions', src: 'text.vtt', srclang: 'en'}, false);
```
Now when the player loads, this captions track is actually missing because it was removed.

Instead of adding auto-removal tracks immediately to the list, wait until we've selected a source before adding them in.

It allows you to use string as an key for the language files but have a default value that's different. In this case, we have a key of progress bar timing: currentTime={1} duration={2} which is used so that we have a descriptive key to what is happening. The default value matches that default value in en.json: {1} of {2}.

This fixes a lot of the issues from #2746 by making the dialog inherit from our actual ModalDialog which now has tab focus trapping.

The Captions Settings dialog has some accessibility issues:
- Field labels and fields are not explicitly associated
- Keyboard focus does not move into the dialog when it is opened
- Keyboard focus is not trapped inside the dialog while it is open
- Keyboard focus does not return to the control which opened the dialog when it is closed
- The extent (top and bottom) of the dialog is not indicated to screen readers
- The dialog cannot be closed with the Esc key
- The meaning of '---' in the select fields is not clear
- The control to close the dialog is labeled ""Done"" rather than ""Close""
- The purpose of the ""Defaults"" button may not be obvious, and its effect may not be apparent to screen reader users
- Focus highlighting (outline) on the Default and Done buttons is *very* hard to see
- Pressing the Done button doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same effect as pressing the Close (x) button; does it trigger the same focus movement
- This requirement to move it back to the triggering element is tricky, since clicking on that item in the CC menu dismisses the CC menu. I need to think about this a little more - either the menu should open again, or the focus should go to the main CC Menu Button
- The focus outline on the whole dialog goes too far to the left (all the way to the edge of the video window, not just to the edge of the dialog)

Add middleware support. Middleware can function as go-between between the player and the tech. For example, it can modify the duration that the tech returns to the player. In addition, middleware allow for supporting custom video sources and types.

Currently, middleware can only intercept timeline methods like duration, currentTime, and setCurrentTime.

For example,
```js
videojs.use('video/foo', {
  setSource(src, next) {
    next(null, {
      src: 'http://example.com/video.mp4',
      type: 'video/mp4'
    });
  }
});
```
Will allow you to set a source with type `video/foo` which will play back `video.mp4`.

This makes setting the source asynchronous, which aligns it with the spec a bit more. Methods like play can still be called synchronously on the player after setting the source and the player will play once the source has loaded.

`sourceOrder` option was removed as well and it will now always use source ordering.
