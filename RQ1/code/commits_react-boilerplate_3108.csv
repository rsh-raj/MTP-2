Updated all the outdated dependencies.

- I changed the `history` imports following a warning saying our usage was deprecated.
- I also removed `eslint-plugin-compat` (which was a recent addition).

## React Boilerplate

The saga and reducer injectors are normally used via HOCs.

The HOCs will still work with Hooks-based components but IMO, we can offer a nice alternative which doesn't pollute the render tree:

`useInjectSaga` and `useInjectReducer` hooks!

You can see this alternative in this PR's diff [here](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/pull/2583/files?w=1) (with the no whitespace option enabled).

We probably shouldn't remove the HOCs as the Hooks-based injectors won't work with Class components.

I do have one question about the InjectSaga HOC: It passes props to `injectSaga`. What's the purpose of this and is there any way around it?

This is more of an RFC than anything else. Looking for thoughts and feedback before completing the branch.

Cheers!

PS: `react-helmet@5` + `useEffect` in the same component = 🧨💥🔥 so I upgraded us to the 6.0.0 beta.

- Immutable data without the need to use Immutable's custom data types
- Essentially no learning curve
- Removes over 50k from our builds
- Trivial to remove for anyone who doesn't want it. We could even add it as an option in the generators.

* Rewritten the generate-templates-for-linting script (#2473)

## React Boilerplate

### A problem

In order to test the generator functionality the `test-generators-without-a-trace` is executed on Travis. This runs all generators for components/containers and language.
Then the linter is scheduled to run so it inlcudes these generated components etc.

But any, snapshot, test for components wrapped in `<LanguageProvider />` fail because of the added language by the language generator.

### A solution

Therefore I've rewritten the `test-generators-without-a-trace` script. It runs all generators as before but checks for linting issues right after and on the component, container or modified file, if the generation was successful.
When the generator actions were successful and no linting problems were found the component, container or any added files are removed and modified files are restored.
In case any error occured the component, container or any added files are NOT removed and modified files are NOT restored so issues can be traced.

Rather than a huge ambitious webpack overhaul, I tackled just 1 big piece and 1 small: the DLL plugin and polyfills.

**DLL**

I've completely removed the DLL setup we had going and replaced it with `webpack.optimization` and `compression-webpack-plugin`.

I've set optimizations for splitting chunks in prod to handle vendor cache groups, which is pretty snappy in development. I've also setup `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin` to enable caching and multi-process parallel running at the same time (this is handled in optimization as well). Along with this, I've added compression plugin to build gzipped bundles. These are served by express and the bundles are cut down by half or more.

**Polyfill**

I've added [`react-app-polyfill`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-app-polyfill) that has common polyfills for the browser and supports up to IE11.",False

Upgrade to `styled-components` v4 is fully tested and working. Minor doc updates included.

Tests are now using enzyme's `mount` and styled-components's `enzymeFind` util (perhaps a good argument for switching to `react-testing-library` per @Mensae's advice?).
