* Implement a faster version of toASCIIUppercase(), which is used by tagName. (Also do the same for toASCIILowercase() while we're there.)

* Most importantly, stop accessing nodeName when possible:
    * In the non-error cases of _preInsertValidity(), we can just avoid it. This shows up for all appends.
    * In the isNamedPropertyElement() check, we can just use _localName. This also shows up for all appends.

* Improve _insert performance from O(n^2) to O(n):

  ""n"" here refers to the tree depth of the node being inserted, so lots of nested elements causes insertion to be extremely slow. Deep cloning, for example, calls _insert O(n) times, which makes cloning O(n^3) without this optimization and O(n^2) with it.

  It works by only checking isConnected (which is O(n)) once on the node being inserted rather than checking it on every single descendant of the node being inserted. Checking isConnected for every descendant isn't necessary since any node should have the same isConnected value as any other node in the same node tree.

* Improve contains performance:

  The previous implementation of a node's contains method uses compareDocumentPosition, which runs a lot of extra features that aren't used by contains. In some measurements this reduces the time spent from 560 ms down to 30 ms. The new implementation works by simply checking each ancestor of the other node until it finds the this node (as in this.contains(other)), rather than checking a number of relationships between the two nodes but utilizing only one of them.

Also removes ""obsolete node type"" errors from compareDocumentPosition(), since those were removed from the spec.",False

This commit deals with two cases where the current activation behavior
for <label> elements is deficient:

- When the target of the event that triggered said activation behavior
  is in fact part of some interactive content descendant of the <label>,
  then nothing should be done.

- When the target of the event is an inclusive descendant of the labeled
  control, then the control presumably has already received this event,
  so nothing more should be done by the <label> element.

The former case is specifically treated by the spec as a no-op case,
under https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C/#the-label-element. This applies to
such trees as

    <label>
      <button>Click me!</button>
    </label>

Since the <button> is labelable, if upon clicking the button the <label>
element tries to click the button once again, then an infinite recursion
would result. This is indeed the essence of #2717.

The latter case is not mentioned in the spec directly, but is
implemented by all major browsers. Consider instead the following tree:

    <label>
      <progress>Click me too!</progress>
    </label>

The <progress> element is not interactive, and therefore does not fall
under the jurisdiction of the previous case. But it is still labelable,
and is the labeled control of the <label> element. So when the
<progress> element is clicked, the <label> should also avoid trying to
click the <progress>; otherwise, infinite recursion would emerge here as
well.

It may first appear that the first case is a special case of the second;
indeed, the example above with a single button would fall into the
second case also. But this is not true in general. Consider instead:

    <label>
      <button>Don't click me!</button>
      <button>Click me!</button>
    </label>

If the second button is clicked, then this falls into the first case but
not the second. But we still need to prevent the <label> from clicking
the first button (the actual labeled control) instead.

The monkey-patch for maintaining the open element stack, as modified by commit 75a921eab52c239b2468e08be9f547f46c7f86bd, maintained a reference to the most recent JSDOMParse5Adapter through the push/pop closures. This means there was always a reference from the rooted OpenElementStack.prototype.{push,pop} functions to the most recent JSDOMParse5Adapter and its related objects. Since one of the related objects was an element, which has a pointer to a document and window, essentially the whole JSDOM would be retained.

This commit instead uses the this.treeAdapter pointer, which already exists in parse5. Doing so also allows us to move the monkeypatch back into the top level, instead of establishing it on construction of each tree adapter.

This pull request fixes the issue discussed here: https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/pull/2398#discussion_r230072618. Before this change, innerHTML and outerHTML would directly manipulate their thisArg, using appendChild() and removeChild(), instead of instead of creating a fragment and inserting it in the DOM at the end of the parsing. Moving to the per-spec architecture fixes various correctness issues.

Other changes:

- Create a generic parser module exposing two methods: parseFragment and parseDocument. This abstracts over the HTML vs. XML distinction.
- Migrate all the internal usages of the ""htmltodom"" module to use the new parser module.
- Adjust the implementation of Element's innerHTML, outerHTML, and insertAdjacentHTML(), as well as ShadowRoot's innerHTML, to closer match to the spec.
- Update saxes and w3c-xmlserializer to improve XML parsing/serialization.",False

* Resource-loading options are set by passing them to the ResourceLoader constructor, not to the JSDOM constructor. In particular userAgent, which used to be in the JSDOM constructor in v11, moves to ResourceLoader. (The others were only added to the JSDOM constructor in recent commits.)
* Cut down on the resource loading customizability for now. Only strictSSL, proxy, and userAgent are supported; no agent customization, since it turns out that is pretty weird and broken.
* Make JSDOM.fromURL use the resource loader, if one is supplied.
* Make it more explicit which options ResourceLoader.prototype.fetch and PerDocumentResourceLoader.prototype.fetch take (not many).
* Remove some old options-passing that was only to support old API functionality.

Note that for now XMLHttpRequest does not use the resource loader; it never has, but it should in the future. In the meantime we continue the janky pattern of copying over a few options into those request() calls specifically.

Also note that the keep-alive connection stuff appears to have been broken for a while (the test which was supposed to be testing that only a single connection was made, in fact tested that at least one connection was made). So, we delete those tests, as part of the reduction in flexibility mentioned above. If we reintroduce that flexiblity then we'll write better tests.",False

This changes the HTML parsing infrastructure, in particular how we interface with parse5. The original motivation for this change was increased performance; the new benchmark, which appends 65535 <tr>s, gets a speedup of ~3x from these changes.

Other user-visible changes to script evaluation might be present. In particular, the tests revealed that one document.write-related test that used to somehow pass now fails, while another one succeeds (at least on Node 8). In most cases, however, behavior should be the same.

While here, we also changed style sheets to reevaluate their rules and update styleEl.sheet or linkEl.sheet appropriately when their child text content changed.

Behind the scenes details:

- We now use a parse5 tree adapter directly for parsing, instead of using the htmlparser2 adapter layer (which had an O(n) insertion cost for new siblings)
- SAX XML parsing code has been simplified by no longer being shared with parse5/htmlparser2 parsing code.
- Nodes no longer have a reference to the ""core"" god-object. This was only used in a couple places, and was error prone because this reference was not available in cases such as document nodes created via the Document constructor. This removes a lot of code that threaded the object throughout everything.
- We continued to use hacky workarounds for script evaluation, during parsing and elsewhere. Perhaps one day, inspired by #1316 and #1920, we can fix these.",False

This introduces the new API, and a bunch of tests covering it. It replaces the old API as jsdom's default API, but the old API is still available, as explained in the new README.

* Changes the minimum Node.js version to v6 so we can start using new ECMAScript features.
* Changes the virtual console's omitJsdomErrors option to omitJSDOMErrors, for consistency.
* Fixes img elements to no longer fire load events unless they actually load something (which is only true in general when canvas is installed).
* Makes the browser vm shim better in a few ways:
  - Use of `this` at top level works now
  - Use of `sandbox.eval()` works more like it does in Node
  - Adds a `Script` shim
* Test reorganization and fixes:
  - Consolidates all tests of web platform features into test/to-port-to-wpts.
  - Consolidates all tests of the old API specifically to test/old-api.
  - Removes some old API tests when they were redundant with new API tests; old API will lose coverage, but it's going away eventually anyway.
  - Removes the jqueryify_url test, which wouldn't pass when offline; it's OK to lose some coverage for the old API.
  - Removes tests that weren't being run (mostly level3 stuff) or fixtures that weren't being used.
  - Updates port-finding and server setup to be more resilient in general.",False

This completely removes mutation events from jsdom. (Fixes #295, finally.)

Mutation events are no longer part of the DOM Standard, even though they are part of all existing browsers. They have been superceded by mutation observers.

Our hope was to implement mutation observers before removing mutation events. However, recent performance testing reveals that mutation events cause a *massive* slowdown of common DOM operations (like adding nodes or attributes, including during parsing). For example, compiling the ECMAScript draft spec is done using jsdom; compilation time goes from over a minute to less than thirty seconds with this change. Thus, it is worthwhile to remove mutation events even without their replacement in sight yet.",False
