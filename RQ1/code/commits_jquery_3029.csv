The `hidden` attribute used to be a boolean one but it gained a new
`until-found` eventually. This led us to change the way we handle boolean
attributes in jQuery 4.0 in gh-5452 to avoid these issues in the future.

We haven't added an explicit test for the `""until-found""` value of the
`hidden` attribute which triggered this decision so far, though.
Backport the test from gh-5607 which landed on `3.x-stable` so that we
do test it.

Closes gh-5619

Changes:
1. Fix measurements of `<col span=""2"">` elements in Firefox.
2. Fix measurements of all implicitly sized `<col>` elements in Safari.

Firefox always reports computed width as if `span` was 1. In Safari, computed
width for columns is always 0. Work around both issues by using `offsetWidth`.

In IE/Edge, `<col>` computed width is `""auto""` unless `width` is set explicitly
via CSS so measurements there remain incorrect. Because of the lack of a proper
workaround, we accept this limitation.

So far, a result of an event handler has been assigned to the `returnValue`
of the original event by jQuery. Initially, one could pass a message the browser
will then display to the user. Since that got abused a lot, every browser
stopped using the provided string and they all now provide a generic message.
From the browsers supported in v4, only IE 11 would still display the message.

Incidentally, IE 11 is the only browser from our supported ones which respects
the value returned from a beforeunload handler attached by `addEventListener`;
other browsers do so only for inline handlers, so not setting the value directly
shouldn't reduce any functionality.

This looks like a good moment to stop passing the message through and just call
`event.preventDefault()` without extra checks which is shorter. This used to
not work in Chrome but it got implemented in Chrome 119.

Unfortunately, it's hard to test this event in unit tests since it blocks page
dismissal.

So far, we were mostly optimizing gzipped sizes. However, using Brotli is more

better. It makes sense to also pay attention to these numbers.

The `comparseSize` version stays at `2` as this only introduces a new field
without affecting existing ones. The only drawback is comparisons with branches
that didnt have Brotli computed before will return `NaN`. This can be easily
fixed locally by checking out the branch and running the build, but at least
we don't lose gzipped sizes in the meantime.

When passing a result of `getElementByTagsName` to `jQuery.cleanData`, convert

In Firefox, alert displayed just before blurring an element dispatches
the native blur event twice which tripped the jQuery logic if a jQuery blur
handler was not attached before the trigger call.

This was because the `leverageNative` logic part for triggering first checked if
setup was done before (which, for example, is done if a jQuery handler was
registered before for this element+event pair) and - if it was not - added
a dummy handler that just returned `true`. The `leverageNative` logic made that
`true` then saved into private data, replacing the previous `saved` array. Since
`true` passed the truthy check, the second native inner handler treated `true`
as an array, crashing on the `slice` call.

The same issue could happen if a handler returning `true` is attached before
triggering. A bare `length` check would not be enough as the user handler may
return an array-like as well. To remove this potential data shape clash, capture
the inner result in an object with a `value` property instead of saving it
directly.

Since it's impossible to call `alert()` in unit tests, simulate the issue by
replacing the `addEventListener` method on a test button with a version that
calls attached blur handlers twice.

The HTML spec defines boolean attributes:
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#boolean-attributes
that often correlate with boolean properties. If the attribute is missing, it
correlates with the `false` property value, if it's present - the `true`
property value. The only valid values are an empty string or the attribute name.

jQuery tried to be helpful here and treated boolean attributes in a special way
in the `.attr()` API:
1. For the getter, as long as the attribute was present, it was returning the
   attribute name lowercased, ignoring the value.
2. For the setter, it was removing the attribute when `false` was passed;
   otherwise, it was ignoring the passed value and set the attribute -
   interestingly, in jQuery `>=3` not lowercased anymore.

The problem is the spec occasionally converts boolean attributes into ones with
additional attribute values with special behavior - one such example is the new
`""until-found""` value for the `hidden` attribute. Our setter normalization
means passing those values is impossible with jQuery. Also, new boolean
attributes are introduced occasionally and jQuery cannot easily add them to the
list without incurring breaking changes.

This patch removes any special handling of boolean attributes - the getter
returns the value as-is and the setter sets the provided value.

To provide better backwards compatibility with the very frequent `false` value
provided to remove the attribute, this patch makes `false` trigger attribute
removal for ALL non-ARIA attributes. ARIA attributes are exempt from the rule
since many of them recognize `""false""` as a valid value with semantics different
than the attribute missing. To remove an ARIA attribute, use `.removeAttr()` or
pass `null` as the value to `.attr()` which doesn't have this exception.

We cannot pass a single file via the `module` condition as then
`require( ""jquery"" )` will not return jQuery but instead the module object
with `default`, `$` & `jQuery` as keys. Instead:

1. For Node.js, detected via the `node` condition:
    1. Expose a regular CommonJS version to `require`
    2. Expose a tiny wrapper over CommonJS to `import`
2. For bundlers, detected via the `module` condition:
    1. Expose a regular ESM version to `import`
    2. Expose a tiny wrapper over ESM to `require`
3. If neither Node.js nor bundlers are detected (no `node` or `module`
   conditions`):
    1. Expose a regular CommonJS version to `require`
    2. Expose a regular ESM version to `import`

The reasons for such definitions are as follows:
1. In Node.js, one can synchronously import from a CommonJS file inside of
   an ESM one but not vice-versa. To use an ESM file in a CommonJS one,
   a dynamic import is required and that forces asynchronicity.
2. In some bundlers CommonJS is not necessarily enabled - e.g. in Rollup without
   the CommonJS plugin. Therefore, the ESM version needs to be pure ESM.
   However, bundlers allow synchronously calling `require` on an ESM file. This
   is possible since bundlers merge the files before they are passed to
   the browser to execute and the final bundles no longer contain async import
   code.
3. Bare ESM & CommonJS versions are provided to non-Node non-bundler
   environments where we cannot assume interoperability between ESM & CommonJS
   is supported.
4. Bare versions cannot be supplied to Node or bundlers as projects using both
   ESM & CommonJS to fetch jQuery would result in duplicate jQuery instances,
   leading to increased JS size and disjoint data storage.

In addition to the above changes, the `script` condition has been dropped. Only
Webpack documents this condition and it's not clear when exactly it's triggered.
Adding support for a new condition can be added later without a breaking change;
removing is not so easy.

The `production` & `development` conditions have been removed as well. They were
not really applied correctly; we'd need to provide both of them to each current
leaf which would double the size of the definition for the `.` & `./slim` entry
points. In jQuery, the only difference between development & production builds
is minification; there are no logic changes so we can pass unminified versions
to all the tooling, expecting minification down the line.

As for the factory entry points:
1. Node.js always gets the CommonJS version
2. Bundlers always get the ESM version
3. Other tools take the ESM version when using `import` and the CommonJS when
   using `require`.

The complexity is lower than for the `.` & `./slim` entry points because there's
no default export to handle so Node/bundler wrapper files are not necessary.

Other changes:
* Tests: Change ""node:assert"" to ""node:assert/strict""; the former is deprecated
* Docs: Mention that the CommonJS module doesn't expose named exports
* Tests: Run Node & bundler tests for all the above cases

This is a complete rework of our testing infrastructure. The main goal is to modernize and drop deprecated or undermaintained dependencies (specifically, grunt, karma, and testswarm). We've achieved that by limiting our dependency list to ones that are unlikely to drop support any time soon. The new dependency list includes:

- `qunit` (our trusty unit testing library)
- `selenium-webdriver` (for spinning up local browsers)
- `express` (for starting a test server and adding middleware)
  - express middleware includes uses of `body-parser` and `raw-body`
- `yargs` (for constructing a CLI with pretty help text)
- BrowserStack (for running each of our QUnit modules separately in all of our supported browsers)
  - `browserstack-local` (for opening a local tunnel. This is the same package still currently used in the new Browserstack SDK)
  - We are not using any other BrowserStack library. The newest BrowserStack SDK does not fit our needs (and isn't open source). Existing libraries, such as `node-browserstack` or `browserstack-runner`, either do not quite fit our needs, are under-maintained and out-of-date, or are not robust enough to meet all of our requirements. We instead call the [BrowserStack REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) directly.

## BrowserStack Runner
- automatically retries individual modules in case of test failure(s)
- automatically attempts to re-establish broken tunnels
- automatically refreshes the page in case a test run has stalled
- runs all browsers concurrently and uses as many sessions as are available under the BrowserStack plan. It will wait for available sessions if there are none.
- supports filtering the available list of browsers by browser name, browser version, device, OS, and OS version (see `npm run test:unit -- --list-browsers` for more info). It will retrieve the latest matching browser available if any of those parameters are not specified.
- cleans up after itself (closes the local tunnel, stops the test server, etc.)
- Requires `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

## Selenium Runner
- supports running any local browser as long as the driver is installed, including support for headless mode in Chrome, FF, and Edge
- supports running `basic` tests on the latest [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#readme), which can be seen in action in this PR (see `test:browserless`)
- Node tests will run as before in PRs and all non-dependabot branches, but now includes tests on real Safari in a GH actions macos image instead of playwright-webkit.
- can run multiple browsers and multiple modules concurrently

Other notes:
- Stale dependencies have been removed and all remaining dependencies have been upgraded with a few exceptions:
  - `sinon`: stopped supporting IE in version 10. But, `sinon` has been updated to 9.x.
  - `husky`: latest does not support Node 10 and runs on `npm install`. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.
  - `rollup`: latest does not support Node 10. Needed for now until git builds are migrated to GitHub Actions.
- BrowserStack tests are set to run on each `main` branch commit
- `debug` mode leaves Selenium browsers open whether they pass or fail and leaves browsers with test failures open on BrowserStack. The latter is to avoid leaving open too many sessions.
- This PR includes a workflow to dispatch BrowserStack runs on-demand
- The Node version used for most workflow tests has been upgraded to 20.x
- updated supportjQuery to 3.7.1

The `attrHooks` entries for boolean attributes are only defined for jQuery 4+;
jQuery 3.x used a separate mechanism - assigning them to
`jQuery.expr.attrHandle`. That object used to be maintained by Sizzle, since
jQuery 3.7.0 it's kept in the selector module. Because of that, the `isXMLDoc`
check used to be require in this hook.

Now that standard `attrHooks` are used, the `isXMLDoc` check already happens
inside of `jQuery.attr` and there's no need to repeat it in the test. Note that
this repetition is even incorrect - while Sizzle's `jQuery.find.attr` used to
treat an `undefined` output of the hooks from `jQuery.expr.attrHandle` as a way
to opt out of the hook, jQuery's `attrHooks` use `null` to opt out of a getter
hook.

Since versions 1.11.0/2.1.0, jQuery has used a module wrapper with one strange
addition - in CommonJS environments, if a global `window` with a `document` was
not present, jQuery exported a factory accepting a `window` implementation and
returning jQuery.

This approach created a number of problems:
1. Properly typing jQuery would be a nightmare as the exported value depends on
   the environment. In practice, typing definitions ignored the factory case.
2. Since we now use named exports for the jQuery module version, it felt weird
   to have `jQuery` and `$` pointing to the factory instead of real jQuery.

Instead, for jQuery 4.0 we leverage the just added `exports` field in
`package.json` to expose completely separate factory entry points: one for the
full build, one for the slim one.

Exports definitions for `./factory` & `./factory-slim` are simpler than for `.`
and `./slim` - this is because it's a new entry point, we only expose a named
export and so there's no issue with just pointing Node.js to the CommonJS
version (we cannot use the module version for `import` from Node.js to avoid
double package hazard). The factory entry points are also not meant for the Web
browser which always has a proper `window` - and they'd be unfit for an
inclusion in a regular script tag anyway. Because of that, we also don't
generate minified versions of these entry points.

The factory files are not pushed to the CDN since they are mostly aimed
at Node.js.

In `leverageNative`, instead of calling `event.stopImmediatePropagation()`
which would abort both native & jQuery handlers, set the wrapper's
`isImmediatePropagationStopped` property to a function returning `true`.
Since for each element + type pair jQuery attaches only one native handler,
there is also only one wrapper jQuery event so this achieves the goal:
on the target element jQuery handlers don't fire but native ones do.

Unfortunately, this workaround doesn't work for handlers on ancestors
- since the native event is re-wrapped by a jQuery one on each level of
the propagation, the only way to stop it for jQuery was to stop it for
everyone via native `stopPropagation()`. This is not a problem for
`focus`/`blur` which don't bubble, but it does also stop `click` on
checkboxes and radios. We accept this limitation.

In IE (all versions), `focus` & `blur` handlers are fired asynchronously
but `focusin` & `focusout` are run synchronously. In other browsers, all
those handlers are fired synchronously. Asynchronous behavior of these
handlers in IE caused issues for IE (gh-4856, gh-4859).

We now simulate `focus` via `focusin` & `blur` via `focusout` in IE to avoid
these issues. This also let us simplify some tests.

This commit also simplifies `leverageNative` - with IE now using `focusin`
to simulate `focus` and `focusout` to simulate `blur`, we don't have to deal
with async events in `leverageNative`. This also fixes broken `focus` triggers
after first triggering it on a hidden element - previously, `leverageNative`
assumed that the native `focus` handler not firing after calling the native 
`focus` method meant it would be handled later, asynchronously, which
was not the case (gh-4950).

`CSS.supports( ""selector(...)"" )` has different semantics than selectors passed
to `querySelectorAll`. Apart from the fact that the former returns `false` for
unrecognized selectors and the latter throws, `qSA` is more forgiving and
accepts some invalid selectors, auto-correcting them where needed - for
example, mismatched brackers are auto-closed. This behavior difference is
breaking for many users.

To add to that, a recent CSSWG resolution made `:is()` & `:where()` the only
pseudos with forgiving parsing; browsers are in the process of making `:has()`
parsing unforgiving.

Taking all that into account, we go back to our previous try-catch approach
without relying on `CSS.supports( ""selector(...)"" )`. The only difference
is we detect forgiving parsing in `:has()` and mark the selector as buggy.

The PR also updates `playwright-webkit` so that we test against a version
of WebKit that already has non-forgiving `:has()`.

So far, `jQuery.Deferred.exceptionHook` used to log error message and stack

do exactly that.

One drawback of the change is that in IE 11 previously stack was printed
directly and now just the error summary; to get to the actual stack
trace, three clicks are required. This seems to be a low price to pay
for having source maps work in all the other browsers, though.

jQuery 3.6.2 started using `CSS.supports( ""selector(SELECTOR)"" )` before using
`querySelectorAll` on the selector. This was to solve gh-5098 - some selectors,
like `:has()`, now had their parameters parsed in a forgiving way, meaning
that `:has(:fakepseudo)` no longer throws but just returns 0 results, breaking
that jQuery mechanism.

A recent spec change made `CSS.supports( ""selector(SELECTOR)"" )` always use
non-forgiving parsing, allowing us to use this API for what we've used
`try-catch` before.

To solve the issue on the spec side for older jQuery versions, `:has()`
parameters are no longer using forgiving parsing in the latest spec update
but our new mechanism is more future-proof anyway.

However, the jQuery implementation has a bug - in
`CSS.supports( ""selector(SELECTOR)"" )`, `SELECTOR` needs to be
a `<complex-selector>` and not a `<complex-selector-list>`. Which means that
selector lists now skip `qSA` and go to the jQuery custom traversal:
```js
CSS.supports(""selector(div:valid, span)""); // false
CSS.supports(""selector(div:valid)""); // true

`CSS.supports( ""selector(:is(SELECTOR))"" )` with `:is`, making it a single

The `<template/>` element `contents` property is a document fragment that may

to recent spec changes - in particular, even if that document fragment is
explicitly adopted into an outer document. We're testing both of those cases
now.

The crash used to happen in `jQuery.contains`. As it turns out, we don't need
to query the supposed container `documentElement` if it has the
`Node.DOCUMENT_NODE` (9) `nodeType`; we can call `.contains()` directly on
the `document`. That avoids the crash.

jQuery has followed the following logic for selector handling for ages:
1. Modify the selector to adhere to scoping rules jQuery mandates.
2. Try `qSA` on the modified selector. If it succeeds, use the results.
3. If `qSA` threw an error, run the jQuery custom traversal instead.

It worked fine so far but now CSS has a concept of forgiving selector lists that
some selectors like `:is()` & `:has()` use. That means providing unrecognized
selectors as parameters to `:is()` & `:has()` no longer throws an error, it will
just return no results. That made browsers with native `:has()` support break
selectors using jQuery extensions inside, e.g. `:has(:contains(""Item""))`.

Detecting support for selectors can also be done via:

```js
CSS.supports( ""selector(SELECTOR_TO_BE_TESTED)"" )
```
which returns a boolean. There was a recent spec change requiring this API to
always use non-forgiving parsing:
https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7280#issuecomment-1143852187
However, no browsers have implemented this change so far.

To solve this, two changes are being made:
1. In browsers supports the new spec change to `CSS.supports( ""selector()"" )`,
   use it before trying `qSA`.
2. Otherwise, add `:has` to the buggy selectors list.

This ensures HTML wrapped in TrustedHTML can be used as an input to jQuery
manipulation methods in a way that doesn't violate the
`require-trusted-types-for` Content Security Policy directive.
This commit builds on previous work needed for trusted types support, including
gh-4642 and gh-4724.

One restriction is that while any TrustedHTML wrapper should work as input
for jQuery methods like `.html()` or `.append()`, for passing directly to the
`jQuery` factory the string must start with `<` and end with `>`; no trailing
or leading whitespaces are allowed. This is necessary as we cannot parse out
a part of the input for further construction; that would violate the CSP rule -
and that's what's done to HTML input not matching these constraints.

No trusted types API is used explicitly in source; the majority of the work is
ensuring we don't pass the input converted to string to APIs that would
eventually assign it to `innerHTML`. This extra cautiousness is caused by the
API being Blink-only, at least for now.

The ban on passing strings to `innerHTML` means support tests relying on such
assignments are impossible. We don't currently have such tests on the `main`
branch but we used to have many of them in the 3.x & older lines. If there's
a need to re-add such a test, we'll need an escape hatch to skip them for apps
needing CSP-enforced TrustedHTML.

See https://web.dev/trusted-types/ for more information about TrustedHTML.

When evaluating scripts, jQuery strips out the possible wrapping HTML comment
and a CDATA section. However, all supported browsers are already doing that
when loading JS via appending a script tag to the DOM which is how we've been
doing `jQuery.globalEval` since jQuery 3.0.0. jQuery logic was imperfect, e.g.
it just stripped the `<!--` and `-->` markers, respectively at the beginning or
the end of the script contents. However, browsers are also stripping everything
following those markers in the same line, treating them as single-line comments
delimiters; this is now also mandated by ECMAScript 2015 in Annex B. Instead
of fixing the jQuery logic, just let the browser do its thing.

We also used to strip CDATA sections. However, this shouldn't be needed as in
XML documents they're already not visible when inspecting element contents and
in HTML documents they have no meaning. We've preserved that behavior for
backwards compatibility in 3.x but we're removing it for 4.0.

Issue gh-4379 was meant to be a bug fix but the JSONP case is a bit special:
under the hood it's a script but it simulates JSON responses in an environment
without a CORS setup and sending JSON payloads on error responses is quite
typical there.

This commit makes JSONP error responses still execute the payload. The regular
script error responses continue to be skipped.

Until now, the AJAX script transport only used a script tag to load scripts
for cross-domain requests or ones with `scriptAttrs` set. This commit makes
it also used for all async requests to avoid CSP errors arising from usage
of inline scripts. This also makes `jQuery.getScript` not trigger CSP errors
as it uses the AJAX script transport under the hood.

For sync requests such a change is impossible and that's what `jQuery._evalUrl`
uses. Fixing that is tracked in gh-1895.

The commit also makes other type of requests using the script tag version of the
script transport set its type to ""GET"", namely async scripts & ones with
`scriptAttrs` set in addition to the existing cross-domain ones.

Previously, `jQuery.ajax` with `dataType: 'json'` with a provided callback was
automatically converted to a jsonp request unless one also specified
`jsonp: false`. Today the preferred way of interacting with a cross-domain
backend is CORS which works in all browsers jQuery 4 will support.

Auto-promoting JSON requests to JSONP ones introduces a security issue as the
developer may be unaware they're not just downloading data but executing code
from a remote domain.

This commit disables the auto-promoting logic.

BREAKING CHANGE: to trigger a JSONP request, it's now required to specify
`dataType: ""jsonp""`; previously some requests with `dataType: ""json""` were
auto-promoted to JSONP.

Concatenating HTML strings in buildFragment is a possible security risk as it
creates an opportunity of escaping the concatenated wrapper. It also makes it
impossible to support secure HTML wrappers like
[trusted types](https://web.dev/trusted-types/). It's safer to create wrapper
elements using `document.createElement` & `appendChild`.

The previous way was needed in jQuery <4 because IE <10 doesn't accept table
parts set via `innerHTML`, even if the element which contents are set is
a proper table element, e.g.:
```js
tr.innerHTML = ""<td></td>"";
```
The whole structure needs to be passed in one HTML string. jQuery 4 drops
support for IE <11 so this is no longer an issue; in older version we'd have
to duplicate the code paths.

IE <10 needed to have `<option>` elements wrapped in
`<select multiple=""multiple"">` but we no longer need that on master which
makes the `document.createElement` way shorter as we don't have to call
`setAttribute`.

All these improvements, apart from making logic more secure, decrease the
gzipped size by 58 bytes.

So far, the slim build was expanded to its full exclusion list, generating the
following `jQuery.fn.jquery`:
```
v4.0.0-pre -ajax,-ajax/jsonp,-ajax/load,-ajax/script,-ajax/var/location,-ajax/var/nonce,-ajax/var/rquery,-ajax/xhr,-manipulation/_evalUrl,-deprecated/ajax-event-alias,-callbacks,-deferred,-deferred/exceptionHook,-effects,-effects/Tween,-effects/animatedSelector,-queue,-queue/delay,-core/ready
```

This commit changes it to just `v4.0.0-pre slim`. Only the pure slim build is
treated this way, any modification to it goes through the old expansion; e.g.
for `custom:slim,-deprecated` we get the following `jQuery.fn.jquery`:
```
v4.0.0-pre -deprecated,-deprecated/ajax-event-alias,-deprecated/event,-ajax,-ajax/jsonp,-ajax/load,-ajax/script,-ajax/var/location,-ajax/var/nonce,-ajax/var/rquery,-ajax/xhr,-manipulation/_evalUrl,-callbacks,-deferred,-deferred/exceptionHook,-effects,-effects/Tween,-effects/animatedSelector,-queue,-queue/delay,-core/ready

smaller.

provided through the COMMIT environment variable which we do in Jenkins - in
minified builds headers has been applied to builds with exclusions as well.

The ""jQuery.ajax() - JSONP - Same Domain"" test is firing a request with
a duplicate ""callback"" parameter, something like (simplified):
```
mock.php?action=jsonp&callback=jQuery_1&callback=jQuery_2
```

There was a difference in how the PHP & Node.js implementations of the jsonp
action in the mock server handled situations like that. The PHP implementation
was using the latest parameter while the Node.js one was turning it into an
array but the code didn't handle this situation. Because of how JavaScript
stringifies arrays, while the PHP implementation injected the following code:
```js
jQuery_2(payload)
```
the Node.js one was injecting the following one:
```js
jQuery_1,jQuery_2(payload)
```
This is a comma expression in JavaScript; it so turned out that in the majority
of cases both callbacks were identical so it was more like:
```js
jQuery_1,jQuery_1(payload)
```
which evaluates to `jQuery_1(payload)` when `jQuery_1` is defined, making the
test go as expected. In many cases, though, especially on Travis, the callbacks
were different, triggering an `Uncaught ReferenceError` error & requiring
frequent manual re-runs of Travis builds.

This commit fixes the logic in the mock Node.js server, adding special handling
for arrays.

PR gh-4550 added support for running ES modules & AMD tests via Karma. This
required reading the `esmodules` & `amd` props from both `QUnit.config` &
`QUnit.urlParams`. By picking these two properties manually, the `dev` one
stopped being respected while ones handled directly by QUnit were fine (like
`hidepassed`). Instead of maintaining the full list of options, the code now
iterates over QUnit URL config and handles the fallbacks in a more generic way.

Apart from that, all jQuery source & test files are now read directly from disk
instead of being cached by Karma so that one can run `grunt karma:chrome-debug`
& work on a fix without restarting that Karma run after each change. A similar
effect could have been achieved by setting `autoWatch` to `true` but then the
main Karma page runs tests in an iframe by default when
`grunt karma:chrome-debug` is run instead of relying on the current debug flow.

* check `typeof` of `noGlobal` instead of using the variable directly
  as it's not available when modules are used
* change the nonce module to be an object as ECMASscript module exports
  are immutable
* remove some unused exports

This commit removes Sizzle from jQuery, inlining its code & removing obsolete
workarounds where applicable.

The selector-native module has been removed. Further work on the selector
module may decrease the size enough that it will no longer be necessary. If
it turns out it's still useful, we'll reinstate it but the code will look
different anyway as we'll want to share as much code as possible with
the existing selector module.

The Sizzle AUTHORS.txt file has been merged with the jQuery one - people are
sorted by their first contributions to either of the two repositories.

The commit reduces the gzipped jQuery size by 1460 bytes compared to master.

npm 5, even the version included in the latest Node.js 8.5.0 re-generates
`package-lock.json` on each install. And when it does on a system that doesn't
support all the optional dependencies that are supported on the OS where the
lockfile was generated, it removes those optional deps from the lockfile.

The effect is that everyone firing `npm install` on our repo on any OS other
than macOS will immediately get a dirty state of the repo as the `fsevents`
dependency subtree gets removed from `package-lock.json`. That's a really bad
experience.

This commit removes package-lock.json from the repository and adds it to
.gitignore. We'll start committing the file again once the issue is resolved
on npm's part.

rAF logic was introduced almost three years ago relative to this commit,
as a primary method for scheduling animation (see gh-1578 pull).

With it there was two substantial changes - one was explicitly mentioned
and the other was not.

First, if browser window was hidden aka `document.hidden === true`
it would immediately execute all scheduled animation without waiting
for time pass i.e. tick time become `0` instead of 13 ms of a default value.

Which created possibility for circular executions in case if `complete`
method executed the same animation (see gh-3434 issue).

And the second one - since then there was two ways of scheduling animation:
with `setInterval` and `requestAnimationFrame`, but there was a
difference in their execution.

In case of `setInterval` it waited default `jQuery.fx.interval` value before
actually starting the new tick, not counting the first step which wasn't
set to be executed through tick method (aka `jQuery.fx.tick`).

Whereas `requestAnimationFrame` first scheduled the call and executed
the `step` method right after that, counting the first call of
`jQuery.fx.timer`, `tick` was happening twice in one frame.

But since tests explicitly disabled rAF method i.e.
`requestAnimationFrame = null` and checking only `setInterval` logic,
since it's impossible to do it otherwise - we missed that change.

Faulty logic also was presented with `cancelAnimationFrame`, which couldn't
clear any timers since `raf` scheduler didn't define new `timerId` value.

Because that change was so subtle, apparently no user noticed it proving
that both `cancelAnimationFrame` and `clearInterval` code paths are redundant.

Since `cancelAnimationFrame` didn't work properly and rAF is and was a primary
used code path, plus the same approach is used in other popular animation libs.

Therefore those code paths were removed.

These changes also replace two different functions which schedule the animation
with one, which checks what type of logic should be used and executes it
appropriatley, but for secondary path it now uses `setTimeout` making it more
consistent with rAF path.

Since ticks are happening globally we also don't require to listen
`visibilitychange` event.

It also changes the way how first call is scheduled so execution of
animation will not happen twice in one frame.

No new tests were not introduced, since now `setTimeout` logic should be
equivalent to the rAF one, but one test was changed since now we actually
execute animation at the first tick.

IE 11 used to have an issue where if an element inside an iframe was put
in fullscreen mode, the element dimensions started being 100 times too small;
we've added a workaround that would multiply them by 100. However, the IE 11
issue has been unexpectedly fixed and since our detection was really detecting
the browser and not a bug, we've started breaking the browser instead of fixing
it.

Since there's no good way to detect if the bug exists, we have to back the
workaround out completely.

jQuery used to lower-case the attribute names passed to the .attr setter
to workaround an old IE issue. This is no longer in jQuery 3.0 and
removing it may even ""accidentally"" make this API sort-of work on SVGs
(see gh-2910) so why not.

Manual lowercasing had to be added to the place where the proper
attrHook is retrieved so that it works regardless of the casing of the
provided name. A regular `toLowerCase()` is enough there as those few
attributes don't contain any non-ASCII characters.
